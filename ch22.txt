p1:
 title:Would you mind if we pass through real quick?!
 
p2:
 b1:Trial Tower Third Floor
 b2:Die
 b3:In the end, none of them ever listen.
 b4:They always understimate us and attack recklessly...
 b5:I guess they put alot of faith in that 'status' thing...
 b6:If they just used their brains for a moment, they would realize that we've survived somehow.
 b7:Hmm, it's true that the unimaginitve always end up dying.
 b8:Also... I may be overly self-conscious, but...
 
p3:
 b1:Aren't they always focusing on me?
 b2:It's like their second statement is always something like 'leave the girl'...
 b3:Yeah, you're right.
 b4:I don't know if I want to know the answer, but... for me, uhm...
 b5:why do they feel like attacking me so much?
 b6:Well, it might just be that the people are going crazy and acting out of instinct, but...
 b7:Yeah, it's because your attractive. And cute.
 b8:And you've got a good figure.
 b9:I can understand the feelings of a guy who wants to assault you.
 b10:Wha?!
 
p4:
 b1:Ah, don't worry. I won't attack you.
 b2:Asaka-san told me that forcing it was no good.
 b3:Then if I agree to it?!
 b4:I don't think you need to 'attack' if you have approval, but...
 b5:In that case, there are no factors to hesitate over?
 b6:It feels like I've been accidentally pinned down several times though!
 text:Like that time in Hanabusa!
 b7:It's an irresistible force.
 b8:If it happens by accident, then the situation is one to enjoy.
 b9:so positive?!
 b10:This is the first time I've seen someone so positive about lucky situations.
 b11:Are you impressed?!
 
p5:
 b1:I'm also impressed in my descendant trying to start a Rom-Com story in a situation like this.
 b2:You've become suprisingly bold.
 b3:a-anyways, let's keep going!!
 b4:The second floor's stairs are just ahead!
 b5:trial tower second floor
 b6:What? This door...
 b7:This is the biggest difference so far...
 b8:Well, I'm just going to break it anyways though.
 
p6:
 b1:W-what's this...?
 b2:an arena...?!
 
p7:
 b1:There's a fight between actual swordsmen!!
 b2:It's a nice change of pace from all the colorful people who've attacked us so far...
 b3:I remember seeing the three people over there on the roof.
 b4:Shiro
 b5:Do you understand me? That attack is no big deal.
 b6:There's no need to be scared.
 b7:Maybe I can do it too, Masaki-sama? 
 
p8:
 b1:well then, here I gooo!!
 restore bubble 2
 b3:You little!
 b4:My clothes keep getting smaller and smaller!
 
p9:
 b1:Haiyaaa
 
p10:
 b1:eh...? she just swung it down so lazily?!
 b2:Also, despite her clothes getting cut off, she's completely intact.
 b3:The other person seems quite skillful though...
 b4:The uninjured one has a round tail, maybe they're a bunny person.
 b5:I don't care about that right now?!
 b6:Hey, don't stare so intently!
 b7:Even if they were naked, they'd still be a bunny person...
 b8:No no, without the ears and tail, she'd just be a beautiful girl, right?!
 b9:Even if she's a beautiful girl, the extra parts cause me to lose interest.
 b10:Why are you so committed to this?!
 b11:Anyways
 b12:What do you intend to do now?
 b13:We don't really care about the fight, so we should just quickly leave this room.
 b14:Hm? This room's exit...
 
p11:
 b1:Maybe it's behind that group over there?
 b2:There's probably no way we can get past without killing them though, right?
 b3:Why would we kill them if they are just in the way.
 b4:I think we should just wait a little.
 b5:But
 b6:It doesn't look like it's going to end any time soon...
 b7:eh?
 
p12:
 b1:Kyaan!
 b2:That hurts y'know!
 b3:tch...
 b4:What is this! This sucks!
 b5:Hey! This sword is too heavy!

p13:
 b1:Kyaaa!
 b2:Hiee... That looked painful...
 b3:The bunny person looks fine though...
 b4:The woman in the mantle is precisely aiming for all the vital points.
 b5:She's very skillful, but it's still not effective...
 b6:Heyy! You've been attacking wierd places for a while now!
 
p14:
 b1:Damn...
 b2:Shouldn't you start getting serious?
 b3:Is there any point in maintaining that disguise any longer?
 b4:If my lie has been found out...
 b5:Then I might as well give up on hiding it.
 
p15:
 b1:Heh... So this is the real you.
 b2:You're a half-devil.
 b3:Now that you've seen this form...
 b4:I must finish this before it becomes a hinderance!
 
p16:
 b1:Haaaa!
 b2:Kyaaa
 
p17:
 b1:Kyaaaa
 b2:It hurts! Masaki-sama!! It huuuurts!
 b3:You'll be fine if you put your arm back on.
 b4:You really are hopelessly weak though with a sword, Shiro...
 b5:Fight without a sword this time.
 b6:Okaaay
 b7:Well then...
 
p18:
 b1:Kuh...
 
p19:
 b1:Shiro can move much faster without a sword, Masaki-sama!
 b2:That bunnygirl suddenly got alot faster...
 b3:It seems like the cloaked woman can withstand the attacks though.
 b4:The attacks seem to be just as effective as they were earlier...
 b5:In other words, it's unlikely this will be settled soon?
 b6:That's annoying...
 b7:In a situation like this...
 
p20:
 b1:It might be good idea to try discussion.
 b2:I don't have any memory of discussion working so far?!
 b3:Excuse me!
 b4:Would you mind if we pass through real quick?!
 
p21:
 b1:Takatou-kun, read the mood!
 b2:Now is not the right time!!
 b3:There was a battle to the death going on!!
 b4:What's this? How did you guys get in this room...
 b5:Ah! I get it.
 b6:You probably broke through the wall without passing through the door I made.
 text:I didn't consider that the tower's walls could be so weak.
 b7:He somehow completely convinced himself...
 b8:Well, it's fine, but...
 b9:You're fighting eachother, right?
 b10:WE don't want to bother either side, so won't you let us pass?
 b11:...No.
 b12:How about you guys keep us company.
 
p22:
 b1:My disciples haven't accumulated 100 points yet.
 b2:If I was alone, I would have defeated this tower in an instant.
 b3:We are here as training for these girls.
 b4:Additionally, we're able to attain points by ambushing anyone who comes here...
 b5:Well then, fighting us would be useless.
 b6:We only have six points between the two of us.
 b7:It's useless to not fight!
 b8:His concern is opposite to us.
 b9:Are you serious?! You're lying.
 b10:WE ended up getting caught up in this trial.
 b11:We're not interested in becoming knights of the holy king, nor do we care about collecting points.
 b12:So, there's no reason not to let us pass, right?
 b13:That's...
 
p23:
 b1:Oh, so it's as simple as walking down the stairs, is it?
 b2:Sure, you might be able to knock down the doors or wall using brute strength, or even go through the floor for that matter.
 b3:However, this is a game where you're meant to collect points.
 b4:I'm just enjoying it according to the rules. And, I won't allow you to act illogically either.
 b5:And you?
 b6:M-me?!
 b7:I don't care what you guys do.
 b8:I'm here gathering points, so I have no reason to fight you.
 b9:A 3vs3 would be good for training.
 b10:If you can defeat these three, then I'll let you pass through.
 b11:Or would you rather me to take you in as disciples as well?
 
p24:
 b1:The bunny over there is Shiro.
 b2:The taller one is Geralda.
 b3:And the small one is Ema.
 b4:I'm starting to seriously doubt Takatou-kun's negotiation skills!!
 b5:Maybe, but I think he's just the type of guy who doesn't listen either way.
 b6:Couldn't you tell that the instant you looked at him?!
 b7:This is a disaster for you guys too...
 b8:If the other two are as powerful or even better than the rabbit, there's almost no chance at victory.
 text:haahaha
 b9:Yes, indeed! After all, Shiro is the weakest!
 b10:Although she's sturdy, her fighting is amateur at best.
 
p25:
 b1:Ema's a swordsman and Geralda specializes in magic.
 b2:He's so confident that he's telling us their abilties...
 b3:Ah, how about we keep the half-devil and Japanese girls as well?
 b4:It doesn't matter what state they're in as long as they're alive.
 b5:Then, do you want us to only kill the boy?
 text:I might want him for personal use.
 b6:The good looking ones must always die.
 b7:Understood.
 b8:T-takatou-kun.
 b9:Yeah
 b10:In this tower, when faced with killing intent, Takatou-kun does only one thing...
 
p26:
 b1:Die
 b2:If Takatou-kun uses his power to protect me...
 b3:Then it's the same as if I do it myself...
 
p27:
 b1:What?! This is the first time I've seen this, but get ready...
 b2:It might be some special battle style or something...?
 b3:We defeated the three people.
 b4:You promised to let us pass, right?
 
p28:
 b1:Let's go ahead, Dannoura-san.
 b2:Okay.
 b3:eh?
 b4:eh?
 b5:It doesn't seem like the door is trapped, but...
 b6:Let me open it just in case.
 sfx:kick
 
p29:n/a

p30:
 b1:Liar
 
 
note1:thanks for reading ch22, ch 23's raw should release 8/27
note2:the Japanese for the tall girl was Ge-Ra-Ru-Da, the WN named the tall girl Gelaruda, I went with Geralda
note3:the end of manga chapter 22 corresponds with the beginning of WN volume 2 chapter 15
note5:The japanese used to describe hald-devil girl is '半魔'. the second character can mean 'demon' or 'devil', but i went with devil because 
	it's the same character used to describe the Devil person. Also, the WN uses half-devil.
note6:i tried to make the font fit better in the bubbles, tell me if its too small or whatnot
