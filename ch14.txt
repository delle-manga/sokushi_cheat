 title:Alpha Omega

p2:
 b1:A certain city in japan
 text:Institute of Higher-Life Sciences (Independent Administrative Corporation)
 b2:uhm... I know I'm not very smart but...
 b3:Are you sure this is a valid document?
 b4:In short, it is a legal contract like "I won't complain even if I die at work", right?
 b5:Yup!
 text:Employment Period Mututal Confirmation Agreement
 b6:The documents are almost meaningless in law, so can you sign them?
 b7:even if you die, it's possible to dispose of everything without a trace.
 b8:You just said something ridiculous without hesitation?!

p3:
 b1:We have alot of intense factional conflicts right now.
 b2:Even though such a thing is trivial, I'll get blamed if I don't do it.
 b3:So, I'd like to be able to say I got the person's approval in advance.
 b4:uuu...
 b5:Suspicious! To be honest, I want to go home!
 b6:But, this is the final interview of all my random job applications...
 b7:If I go home now, I'll have to go job hunting again...
 b8:It's amazing salary and benefits, other than the required dormitory living.
 b9:But still, it takes three hours by bus from the station to the top of the mountain...
 b10:hmm... I'll head home and think it over...
 b11:Wait please!
 b12:You can't go home!
 b13:What is this situation!
 b14:It's like you want me to work as some sort of lab rat...
 b15:Human experimentation at a laboratory is very simple!
 b16:You will just have to work according to the conditions on the job offer slip.
 b17:Well, there may be room for interpretation on what "generic" office work is...

p4:
 b1:This document...what'll happen if I don't sign it?
 b2:I'll throw you in without a detailed explanation.
 b3:Throw me in where!!
 b4:haa... I don't know what I expected in coming here...
 b5:Alright then...
 b6:I'm glad you understand.
 b7:Now then, I'll give you an ID card.
text:Takatou Asaka

p5:
 b1:uhm...what kind of research institute is this?
 b2:Is it some sort of evil secret organization...
 b3:Of course not! After all, we're a research institute that protects Japan and the rest of the world.
 b4:There's a bit of time until we get there. So, I'll explain as we go.
 b5:The door to the offices can't be opened without the ID card, so please don't lose it.
 b6:Now then... Takatou-san, do you know the term "Mutual Assured Destruction"?
 b7:no...
 b8:it's one of the "nuclear deterrents".
 b9:Even if a nuke holding country surprises another, it's possible that the affected country will retaliate with nukes of its own.
 b10:It's obvious that the use of nukes will result in the destruction of both sides.
 b11:And so, we don't use nukes on eachother... It's a theory that "having nuclear weapons will protect one's own country from the nukes of another country".
 b12:...So, while countries around the world are making nuclear weapons, Japan doesn't have a way to counter it.

p6:
 b1:...Does that mean you're doing nuclear weapon research here?!
 b2:You're quick on the pickup, but no.
 b3:The higher-ups are sticking to the Three Non-Nuclear Principles, so nuclear research in Japan isn't really allowed. 
 b4:As such, we are here researching ways to compete with nuclear warfare...
 b5:It's the study of curses.
 b6:In other words, "If you use nuclear attacks, you will curse your country".
 b7:What?

p7:
 b1:At first, I also thought it was...idiotic.
 b2:...However, even if you don't understand the principles or reasoning, you can't help being silenced by the repeatability of phenomenons.
 b3:/b/That's a category covered in science.
 b4:...uhhm, when you said I might die. Did you mean that...
 b5:Yes. By the "curse".
 b6:Ah. When I say curse, there may be an image of dying from writhing in pain for a while but...
 b7:It's fine because you will die instantly without time to feel pain.
 b8:What do you mean that it's fine!!
 b9:Okay, this is where we change elevators.
 b10:It'll be a bit of a walk.
 b11:eh...

p8:
 b1:What is this scary scene?!
 b2:What's all this compact writing everywhere?!
 b3:It's sutra*.	(buddhist scriptures)
 b4:Some people use it to give them some peace of mind...
 b5:eh... uhm...
 b6:What's up ahead of this...
 b7:Takatou-san's workplace.
 b8:It's almost meaningless, but the upper floors are very afraid of "that" and wanted to keep it deep underground.
 b9:So we had to create passages like this and elevators...
 b10:What is the "that"?
 b11:What in the world is my job...
 b12:Takatou-san's job is to take care of a certain subject.

p9:
 b1:You mean "Subject"... is a person.
 b2:Is that person the one who places curses?
 b3:For now, we don't know whether it is a person or not.
 b4:The report says that it has a human figure, but I've never actually seen it.
 b5:eh... it's the research subject, right?
 b6:Is it not being recorded?
 b7:Well...
 b8:We're still at a stage where we know next to nothing about it...
 b9:The record is a piece of writing because of the concern of getting killed just by looking at it.
 b10:Uh... That sounds like something out of a horror film...
 b11:The subject's codename is "AΩ" (Alpha Omega).
 b12:Takatou-san will write reports on AΩ and will also be in charge of taking care of it.
 b13:no...that's...who are they? the person I'll be taking care of...
 b14:Who is AΩ?
 b15:If we knew that, there wouldn't be a problem.

p10:
 b1:At this point, what we know is...
 b2:AΩ can kill anything just by thinking of it.
 b3:At present, we haven't found a way to prevent it.
 b4:In other words, as of now, it can't be used as a weapon since we can not control it.
 b5:Additionally, we can't kill AΩ.
 b6:Is it invincible?
 b7:no, it probably has the regular strength of humans...
 b8:There should be a way to kill it, but there is a reason we can't.
 b9:AΩ detects the attack in advance and counterattacks.
 b10:Since it has that nature, the idea was to use it for Mutual Assured Destruction.
 b11:but...

p11:
 b1:AΩ can kill the opponent just by thinking.
 b2:In other words, if it's not recognized by AΩ, then it can't be the target of the curse, right?
 b3:After all, there's no way to think about someone you don't know or see...
 b4:It's an individual curse... that is, if AΩ wants to kill only indivuidual targets.
 b5:At least, it's been the case so far.
 b6:If AΩ were to target a people in Japan...
 b7:No, /b/it's possible/b/ that he could kill humans all over earth indiscriminately just by thinking.
 b8:Haa?! Isn't that too absurd?
 b9:It's just a possibility, but there's no proof against it.
 b10:So, that's why we try not to mess around with it.
 b11:well... uhm...
 b12:What should I do with such a person...?
 b13:I'd like AΩ to have a Japanese mentality.
 b14:I'd want it to fight back when Japan is attacked.
 b15:Takatou-san has a teacher's license, right?

p12:
 b1:Is that why I was hired...?!
 b2:Yes. Just that.
 b3:AHHHHH! Was I greedy to apply for everything i qualified for!!
 b4:Now then
 b5:This is as far as I can go with my clearance.
 b6:You can get there from here just by following the path.
 b7:I...I have to go alone?!
 b8:Here's the instructions.
 b9:Don't worry. There's nothing difficult.
 b10:Now then, I'm off.
 b11:ehh
 b12:wait...!
 b13:Ah, come on!
 b14:I didn't know humans fell so far!!

p13:
 b1:beep beep
 b2:ohh...
 b3:it opened!
 b4:This door is like a bank safe's...
 b5:If it has to be confined, it's likely to be bad...

p14:
 b1:...ha?!
 b2:A rural scene like this deep underground?!
 b3:What in the world...
 b4:the door is gone...
 b5:It's some sort of landscape image.
 text:It's not as large as I thought.

p15:
 b1:Deep underground in a facility in a mountain past thousands of sutra...
 b2:After all that, I'm scared of what kind of person is down here...
 b3:it looks like i'm supposed to go to the building past the torii...
 b4:Uwaah... It's a perfect Japanese house~!!
 b5:Hello!
 b6:Is anyone there...?!
 p7:Looks like the house isn't just a picture.
 b8:It's dark...
 b9:Excuse meee!
 b10:Is anyone there?!
 
p16:
 b1:There's something moving.
 b2:Maybe that room...
 b3:"AΩ" (Alpha Omega)...
 b4:What kind of monster is it...?!

p17:n/a

p18:
sfx:blank stare

p19:
 b1:ASAKAAAAAAAAAA
 b2:I was afraid for nothing!!
 b3:What could a child like this even do you to!
 b4:ehh?! Large adults are eager to lock such a thing in the basement!
 b5:Why are you so afraid of a kid!!
 b6:Haa?! Are they all idiots!!

p20:
 b1:And you too! You and your pasty, pale body!
 b2:What are you doing quietly trapped in a place like this!!
 b3:eh? uhm
 b4:I've always been in this house though...
 b6:Up you go
 b7:waa
 b8:onee-san...?!

p21:
 b1:Uryaaaa!!
 b2:Come on! We're outside! so play!!
 b3:Play with crayfish, kabuto shrimp, or something transparent and flimsy!
 b4:Play with a firecracker in the ass of a frog!!
 b5:Feel the emotion when you see a worm coming out of a mantis!!

p22:
 b1:I'm so angry that I got scared for nothing...
 b2:And now I'm tired...
 b3:Die
 b4:ehh

p23:
 b1:ehh?!
 b2:What is that black thing...?!
 b3:I dunno? It seems like a bad spirit or something.
 b4:I think it came here by hiding in the shadow of Onee-san.

p24:
 b1:shadow...? demon...?
 b2:I don't know either but...they sometimes come to kill me.
 b3:is that so...
 b4:i was angry and forgot but...
 b5:Is this kid really the "AΩ" that can kill by thinking...?
 b6:Is Onee-san Masaki-san's replacement?
 b7:Masaki-san?
 b8:The person who has been with me at the house until recently!
 b9:A new person sometimes replaces the old person...
 b10:Ah...That's probly right. I came here without understanding though...
 b11:I guess there was someone before me...
 b12:Ah...I'm sorry! I caused you to get scared...!
 b13:I was yelling.
 b14:Anyways, I'm hungry!
 b15:yeah, me too...
 b16:ah, Am i supposed to make it?!
 b17:Masaki-san used to make it...

p25:
 b1:really...i guess that's included in taking care of you.
 b2:Haha, Onee-san's a funny person!
 b3:is that so... even though it was unintentional...
 b4:My name is Takatou Asaka.
 b5:What's your name?
 b6:The people here call me AΩ.
 b7:No, no. That's their codename for you.
 b8:What's your first name?
 b9:First name?
 b10:What's that...?
 b11:before coming here, i was called "Okakushi-sama"...

p26:
 b1:Asaka-san, what is this?
 b2:Is it food?
 b3:It came to this, huh.
 b4:I'm sorry, but we'll have to deal with this for tonight...
 b5:Masaki-san used to have a lot of stuff in the refrigerator.
 b6:Yeah, I already checked there.
 b7:I never cooked for myself because it was too expensive and I didn't know what I was doing...
text:sorry...
 b8:It tastes good.
 b9:A taste I've never eaten.
 b10:really?
 b11:Still though, is this kid really the AΩ they're so afraid of...
 b12:hey... uhhm...
 b13:Well, first off is your name...
 b14:You really don't have one? What did your mother call you?
 b16:Mother?
sfx:blank stare

p27:
 b1:well...I guess its fine.
 b2:Not having a name is inconvenient, and I don't want to keep saying AΩ.
 b3:really?
 b4:Well, Asaka is fine.
 b5:Having the same name would be difficult.
 b6:And too lazy.
 b7:Then, is it fine if I decide it for you?
 b8:Sure
 b9:Okay then..."Yogiri"
 b10:How's that?
 b11:It's the name of the dog I had a long time ago but...
 b12:I remembered him when I saw this child...
 b13:Then, I'm Takatou Yogiri?
 b14:Why did you choose my last name for yourself?!
 b15:Isn't that what you put before your first name?
 b16:Why's it become like a parent and child!!
 b17:...well, it's not like you would know that.

p28:
 b1:Whether he's a monster, a weapon, or a surveillance tool...
 b2:No one until now has ever done something like "living" with this child.
 b3:I feel like this is a job that I'm fine with doing.
 b4:Well theeen. From now on, your name is...
 b5:Takatou Yogiri!
 b6:This is a handsshake!
 b7:"Yoroshiku"! Now you say it!
 b8:Yoroshiku?
T/N:Yoroshiku (yō-rō-sh-kū):nice to meet you, please treat me well

note:
First off, thanks for reading chapter 14. The raws of chapter 15 should release 7/26.
Second, I apologize ahead of time if some of this is translated wrongly/poorly as there was no translated webnovel to base this off.
Third, this chapter is based on content released exclusively in the published light novel (bonus chapter). As such, this manga chapter has no corresponding webnovel chapter, to my knowledge.
Fourth, looking into what 'Okakushi-sama' means, you come across two main results. This series and a book about a mysterious god of money. Breaking it down: O-kakushi-sama (お隠しさま)　means something like 'hidden/secret lord' or just an even more respectful form of lord-sama. But I can't speak to specifics since I don't know Japanese.
Also, the worm coming out of the mantis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8x841FSLgY
Lastly, something interesting. Asaka's name in kanji (朝霞) means 'morning glow'. Yogiri's name in kanji (夜霧) means 'night fog'.
