p1:
 b1:It really is...!
 b2:This is one of Tachibana-kun's followers!
 b3:His guards called her Erika!
 b4:Do you think Tachibana was behind this?
 b5:This is bad... We might have to fight him now.
 b6:Tachibana also lives in this hotel, right?
 b7:We should probably get out of here then.
 b8:I don't know what powers he possesses as Dominator...
 b9:I'd assume he has a grasp of his underlings' undertakings and situation.
sfx:hmm

p2:
 b1:Well then, I'll hurry and get my things together!
 b2:You're fine, dannoura-san?
 b3:ehh?
 b4:well... you sure are calm after seeing a corpse.
 b5:I'm probably not be one to talk though.
 b6:I'm actually pretty shocked...
 b7:But, I might be getting used to it.
 b8:I'm not sure how I feel about that though...
 b9:All humans die eventually.
 b10:Don't expect the daughter of a family of born warriors to be unnerved so easily.
 b11:No, I just try not to think about it?!

p3:
 title:Ch 9: What do you mean you killed ice!? Are you getting philosophical again!?

p4:
 b1:At the same time
 b2:Hanabusa Outskirts Inside a Dungeon
 b3:Erika's perception...
sfx:notification
 b4:stopped transmitting?
 b5:M- master, look out!!
 b6:Be careful! It's over level 1000!
 b7:hmm
sfx:kiiiyaa

p5:
sfx:ranged attack
sfx:shield block

p6:
 b1:What a let-down.
sfx:Giiii?!

p7:
 b1:GYAAAA
 b2:My... My arm?!
 b3:Our boss isn't even strong enough?!
 b4:idiot!
 b5:There's no one with a higher level than our boss...!
 b6:huuh?
 b7:so there were monsters that could talk?
 b8:Lord. After passing a certain level,
 b9:monsters' intelligence will also rise, becoming able to comprehend human language.
 b10:Oh really.
 b11:Might use him as a low-tier slave then.
 b12:A slave?!
 b13:How dare you, a puny human!!

p8: 
 b1:Let's see
 b2:Flare Bomb.
 b3:Was that the right one?
 b4:GYAA...

p9:
 b1:Guh..
 b2:urgh...
sfx:thud
 b3:Guuuh
sfx:stomp
 b4:"Contract"

p10:
 b1:ugh...
 b2:M- master...
 b3:sama...
 b4:okay, heal 'em stephanie.
 b5:Heal!
 b6:The other two died in the Flare Bomb.
 b7:They are your bounty, Lord. Would you like to collect them as subjugation trophies?
 b8:Please do, stephanie.
 b9:As expected of Master!
 b10:A monster of the hundredth floor doesn't stand a chance!
 b11:Well, this thing's level 1000, right?
 b12:With a level ten times as high, that much is to be expected.
 b13:My level has already reached 10,000, ha.

p11:
 b1:Even while doing this, other slaves are out earning experience for me.
 b2:Is master so strong that these ruins are boring?
 b3:Yeah, honest fighting has become tiresome.
 b4:How many floors are there in these ruins?
 b5:There are 150 levels.
 b6:Alright, descend to the bottom and gather new followers as you go.
 b7:If you succeed, head up to the surface.
 b8:I understand.
 b9:That should be enough real battle experience.
 b10:I now know that using skills in the middle of combat can be a bit difficult.
 b11:Was that Flare Bomb?
 b12:Yeah
 b13:To be exact, I used the skill called "Borrow Slave's Skill".

p12:
 b1:"You can borrow any skills of the slaves that serve under you." It's pretty convenient. 
 b2:The skills even become stronger as one's level rises.
 b3:I guess I'll have to be careful to not accidentaly kill something from now on...
 b4:Being too strong has become problem.
 b5:My lord, you already transcend the point where it is actual combat or not.
 b6:Master will surely be the one who reigns as king!
 b7:Now then, shall we return home?
 b8:Oh yeah!
 b9:Erika's perception stopped transmitting a while ago.
 b10:That's strange, Erika and the other two should be waiting back at the hotel...
 []b11:They shouldn't bother master in the middle of battle! What failures of bodyguards!

p13:
 b1:...hmm?
 b2:I don't get it.
 b3:What is it, my lord?
 b4:I just tried watching Erika's memory...
 b5:It seems she died after hiding in a hotel hallway for a while.
 b6:Maybe she was attacked from behind...
 b7:My skill can only share from the perspective of the slave...
 b8:dead...?
 b9:She didn't just faint, right?
 b10:It's difficult to believe an assassin like Erika would be taken from behind...
 b11:Why was Erkia was lurking in a corridor in the first place?

p14:
 b1:The hotel's hallway...
 b2:Was Erika by chance...
 b3:in front of the room of that woman with the strange name? Dannoura, I think.
 b4:In order to watch or kidnap her for you...
 b5:But, I didn't order her to do such?
 b6:Perhaps Erika planned to bring that woman in hopes to to please master...
 b7:Or she might have tried to eliminate her after deeming her unworthy of master.
 b8:I think it is because one of those.
 b9:Eliminate?  
 b10:Wouldn't she aim to act in a way that would not her master problems?
 b11:Of course...
 b12:However, one might act voluntarily if they believe it will benefit their lord.
 b13:What we believe to be right has a possibility of not aligning with your  intentions.

p15:
 b1:oh well
 b2:Now that she's dead... there's no way to figure out what she was thinking.
 b3:Shame, she was expensive.
 b4:There are a few settlements nearby with forest humans like Erika.
 b5:We could raid them if my lord wants to... 
 b6:Settlements like yours?
 b7:Euphemia
 b8:Are you trying to tell me something?
 b9:Absolutely not.
 b10:I was merely mentioning a fact.
sfx:bow

p16:
sfx:sirens
 b1:I thought that sticking with a single woman would be unbecoming of a <Dominator>, but the situation's changed.
 b2:I'll have Riza and Chelsea, who stayed at the hotel, secure Dannoura-san for me.
 b3:The cause of Erika's death...
 b4:Maybe Dannoura will know something.
 b5:Thanks for waiting, Takatou-kun!
sfx:door opens
 b6:Let's go!

p17:
 b1:Let's avoid the elevator and use the emergency stairs instead.
 b2:Yeah
 b3:The stairs are right around this corner-
 b4:My oh my~
 b5:what might have you two in such a rush?
 b6:Fufufu *star*
 b7:Aren't you one of Tachibana's...
 b8:Guard Leader Riza! Why are you here?!

p18:
 b1:Fufuu~
 b2:Juuust following orders!
 b3:Kyaa?!
 b4:What is this?!

p19:
 b1:Fufuu~ You seem to be trapped in ice~
 b2:I was told by Yuuki-kun to bring Dannoura-san with me~
 b3:so if you just come with me quietly, we won't have any prob??
sfx:kick
 b4:huh?
 b5:We can get out here, Dannoura-san.
 b6:eh?!

p20:
 b1:Are these more fragile than they look?
 b2:...Uwaa?!
 b3:So cold!!
 b4:Why are these so hard!!
 b5:I Tried killing the part of ice that I kicked.
 b6:Looks like it worked.
sfx:hmm 
 b7:What do you mean you killed ice!?
 b8:Are you getting philosophical again!?
 b9:...whaa!!

p21:
 b1:What in the world are you!
 b2:I don't understand!
 b3:Uwaa Now a huge icicle...?!
 b4:/b/Icicle, die.
 b5:Now then...
 b6:That /b/staff.
 b7:Die as well.

p22:restore tsu... bubble
 b1:Can you use magic without a staff?
 b2:N-no, I can't...
 b3:Huh?
 b4:The last magic users we met didn't use a staff?
 b5:M-my class is Wand Master.
 b6:It is not a class that can use magic without a wand that has sealed inside magic beforehand...
 b7:If that's the case, then I can render someone powerless with my ability.
 b8:Although, it's only limited to people who depend on items...
 b9:It may have been successful this time, but there's no guarantee.

p23:
 b1:I think you may get it but,
 b2:I will kill you instantly if you try to do anything.
 b3:If you understand then I'll be asking some questions
 b4:U-Understood...
 b5:Since you use wands, you probably have more than that one, right?
 b6:Where's the spares?
 b7:Y-yes.
 b8:This is the only one.
 b9:Why hide it there of all places!?
 b10:And Takatou-kun! Stop staring so intently!

p24:
 b1:But if she has wands that size then she might very well be hiding them elsewhere.
 b2:Should we have her strip...
sfx:hmm hmm
 b3:I'm sure I could kill her /b/clothes but...
text:i've never tried though
 b4:EH?
 b5:Nonono, you're joking, right?
text:The "I can't believe this" Face
 b6:She never complained about killing anyone, but stripping them is a no...
 b7:But how would we know if she is hiding any other wands or powers?
 b8:Wouldn't it be better to kill her?
 b9:If I went around killing people who were potentially dangerous...
 b10:Then soon no one would be left alive around me, you know.

p25:
 b1:You said you were ordered to take along Dannoura-san, right?
 b2:You've got companions, right? Where are they?
 b3:...Fufuu~
 b4:Of course~
 b5:Did they recieve the same orders?
 b6:The ceiling?!

p26: n/a

p27:
 b1:...ah
 b2:...eh
 b3:Just now...
 b4:Dannoura-san?
