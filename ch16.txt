p1:
 b1:hmm... this guy is strong.
 b2:He might be the sword saint/
 b3:mokomoko-san!
 b4:There's too many.
 b5:Okay.
 b6:You all, kill each other until I tell you to stop.
 b7:The people who survive can take the trial.
 b8:The sword saint is the same as everyone else!!
 
p2:
 b1:Can I ask something?
 b2:If I kill everyone here, does that mean i automatically pass?
 b3:Uhhh... You should think before you speak.
 b4:wha...
 b5:If this was an interview that looks at the personality, there would only be one word to describe you.
 b6:...This guy is unexpectedly kind?
 b7:A kind person wouldn't say to kill eachother.
 b8:Hey! Can I ask something?
 b9:What now... didn't you hear what i just said?
 b10:I don't really care if i'm disqualified.
 b11:We just happened to be passing by, but I don't feel like killing people.
 b12:Is it fine to leave?
 
p3:
 b1:wh-what?!
 b2:With this, we've met the sword saint, right?
 b3:please guide us to the exit.
 b4:You're saying you just happened to come to this place?
 b5:...well, I can't have that.
 b6:If there is someone who escapes from this plaza, all of you guys are disqualified.
 b7:How about a time limit too? Let's say 10 minutes.
 b8:If half of you aren't dead in 10 minutes, then you are all disqualified.
 b9:...Alright, that sounds good!
 
p4:
 title:Even if you say you're a celebrity travelling incognito
 
p5:
 b1:fhnn
 b2:ah...?!
 b3:uh oh!
 b4:you've gotten used to this scene, havn't you...
 b5:I can't keep saying 'kyaa kyaa' after all that's happened...

p6:
 b1:oooaahh
 b2:Gyaaaa
 b3:This has become a bit troublesome.
 b4:Escaping would be simple, but...
 b5:Wait! You two!!
 b6:You can't escape!
 b7:Well, if that's how it is...
 b8:I guess killing is my only option...
 b9:Please have peace of mind!!
 
p7:
 b1:I will protect you guys!
 b2:You fools... You guys misundertood sword saint-sama's intention!
 b3:This is a trial!
 b4:To determine if you would act appropriately as a knight of the holy king!
 
p8:
 b1:Is he an actual decent person...?!
 b2:no, I won't believe him so easily!
 b3:I can see that his skill is quite high.
 b4:Everyone here seems pretty capable, but...
 b5:This guy stands out from the rest.
 
p9:
 b1:Haiya!
 b2:He's handling multiple people at the same time with ease.
 b3:Moreover, it looks like he's adjusting his moves based on the attacker's experience!
 b4:But it doesn't seem like he has any intentions to kill them.
 b5:hm?
 b6:This killing intent...
 b7:A long range attack aimed at us?
 b8:die
 
p10:
 b1:huh... what in the world just...
 b2:ah! uhhm
 b3:that is, uhhhhh...
 b4:...it must've been sword saint-sama's power!
 b5:He really did intend to punish the lawless people!
 b6:I didn't even notice his movement! I'm impressed!
 b7:Dammit, these people! Their evil has no limit!
 b8:It's almost time! Rather, the number of people has decreased alot.
 
p11:
 b1:Hmm, it seems they've turned their aim away from us.
 b2:It should be safe now.
 b3:I heard that you just happened to be passing by.
 b4:It's unfortunate, but this trial is very important.
 b5:Could I request that you stay for a while longer?
 b6:In the meantime, I'll do my best to ensure no harm will come your way!
 b7:huuu...
 b8:help...
 b9:...eh?
 
p12:
 b1:the...stone...
 b2:get it...
 b3:the guy from earlier?!
 b4:...just his upper half it seems.
 b5:Still has his right arm and head though...
 b6:This is... truly unfortunate...
 text:he's surviving rather well...
 b7:no, ergh... don't give up on me so easily...
 b8:The girl there! help me!!
 
p13:
 b1:Over there...the rainbow-colored stone...!!
 b2:ehh.
 b3:Put... the stone in my hand!!
 b4:please hurry...!!
 b5:You mean this stone?
 b6:Aaaah! Thank you very much!
 b7:This is...
 b8:An 'apology stone'!
 
p14:
 b1:eh?!
 b2:ohhh, yes... i was saved!
 b3:I thought I was done for!
 b4:Everyone else thought so too!!
 b5:what happened?
 
p15:
 b1:This is a 'star crystal'.
 b2:I got it as an apology item.
 b3:Itâ€™s a convenient thing which can be used for various things like turning a gacha, or healing serious injuries.
 b4:Who?! What?! What are you apologizing for?!
 b5:STOP!
 
p16:
 b1:It's decreased by a good bit.
 b2:We're changing locations, follow me.
 b3:In the forest this time...?
 
p17:
 b1:Takatou-kun... isn't this dangerous?
 b2:Can't we get guided to the capital now.
 b3:No, uhm.
 b4:Keep going if you can!
 b5:I want you to participate in the trial...!
 b6:Why though, Atila?
 
p18:
 b1:All you said we had to do was meet the sword saint.
 b2:uh...uhm.
 b3:The recommender of the person who becomes a knight of the holy king can become a servant of the knight of the holy king.
 b4:So, that's why I'm saying you should aim to become a disciple of the sword saint!
 b5:hmmm...
 b6:Well, we haven't gathered any information yet...
 b7:And we'd just get lost if we left now...
 b8:This is getting more and more troublesome...
 b9:The other's have gone ahead!
 b10:Hurry up!
 
p19:
 b1:Sorry for the late introduction, My name is Rick.
 b2:Though you may know me by various names, please just call me 'Rick'.
 b3:Even if you say you're a celebrity travelling incognito, how would we know?!
 b4:I'm Dannoura Tomochika. We we're on our way to the capital.
 b5:I'm Takatou Yogiri.
 b6:I am called Rainier.
 b7:I'm not too interested in the trial, but i was forcibly invited by my friend...
 
p20:
 b1:Where is your friend?
 b2:She probably thought I died and went on ahead...
 b3:well...
 b4:I'm just glad she didn't take the star crystals.
 b5:The crystals can't be used by anyone but me though.
 b6:You could say that they are tied to my existence.
 b7:I was originally Japanese.
 b8:I've always been disastrously unlucky. It was a miracle I survived until highschool.
 b9:In the end, I got kidnapped by a cult and was killed as a sacrifice for a ritual...
 b10:When I thought I had died, a woman calling herself 'God' appeared.
 b11:So, it came to be that I received apology stones.
 b12:That story skipped way too much!
 
p21:
 b1:I was reincarnated, but my bad luck didn't change.
 b2:So, I got these star crystals (apology stones) as compensation.
 b3:At first, I was aiming for a strong item with the Gacha, but my luck in gacha is also terrible...
 b4:So now, I save up 10 crystals to at least guarentee a rare item.
 b5:Uh...good luck...?
 b6:Don't gods do things like control peoples' destinies though?
 b7:According to humans.
 b8:Some people are guarded by spirts like me.
 b9:But there are also those whose fates are decided by a god.
 b10:What is a sword saint or knight of the holy king?
 b11:well
 b12:I guess I can give a brief explanation...
 
p22:
 b1:First, the various threats this world is exposed to can be broadly divided into two types.
 b2:One is the aggressors.
 b3:They are said to come from outside this world.
 b4:They are handled by the sages.
 b5:You know about the sages, right?
 b6:The other threat was sealed by the gods...
 b7:The so-called 'Devil'.
 
p23:
 b1:The devil is also said to have come from outside this world, but...
 b2:the story is over 1000 years old.
 b3:Even now, it is recognized as a threat to this world.
 b4:The holy king is the one who deals with that devil.
 b5:The devil was completely sealed at the hands of the holy king 1000 years ago.
 b6:eh? It's still a threat even though it's been sealed?
 
p24:
 b1:There are still the devil's powerful children and followers...
 b2:They go crazy all over the place trying to revive the devil.
 b3:They are dealt with by the knights of the holy king.
 b4:It is the sword saint who leads the knights of the holy king.
 b5:hm?
 b6:Aren't they lead by the 'holy king'?
 b7:It seems that the holy king even now continues to suppress the devil in a barrier.
 b8:eh?!
 b9:...For a thousand years?!
 b10:That's what i've heard.
 
p25:
 b1:...huh?
 b2:those people are...
 b3:They disappeared?!
 b4:There is an invisible barrier.
 b5:Things on the inside can't be seen from the outside.
 b6:You can enter without worry.
 
p26:
 b1:uwaaa...!
 b2:What the heck is that...?!
