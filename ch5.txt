p1:
 b1:-Three days later
 b2:uhh...
 b3:Why do I have to crank a charger while being half buried by a fat ghost?!
 b4:My game console's battery was empty and...
 b5:the concierge made the charger for me, so I might as well use it.
 b6:I don't occupy any physical space so there's nothing to be upset about, is there? 

p2:
 ()b1:Well, I'm indebted to Takatou-kun, so I guess it's fine.
 b2:Still though, we were supposed to arrive in half a day, but it's already been two days...
 b3:It can't be helped since the train was attacked by demons.
 b4:No no, I'm never this late!	 Hey you.
 b5:Dear, don't be so rude.
 b6:ah... Is that so?
 b7:Usually the sages' servants, who are riding the train,
 b8:setup a barrier that keeps the demons away.
 b9:So, the demons shouldn't be able to come close on their own...
 b10:But today, hasn't the train has been attacked many times despite these servants' powers?
 b11:Yes, we've had to stop for rests many times... because the servants need to recover their energy to keep up the barrier.
 b12:However, Hanabusa station is just a bit more.
 b13:Without sages, trains wouldn't work in this world...

p3:
 b1:Dear, I think we've taken enough of their time...
 b2:Oh my!
 b3:I'm sorry, I didn't notice you two were alone.
 b4:ehh...?!
 b5:Hohoho! It seems you two look like a couple?
 b6:That's because others can't see you Mokomoko!
 b7:You can see me right, Takatou-kun?
 b8:Yeah. Ever since, Dannoura-san told me about you.
 b9:Even though you never noticed, I have been with you as your guardian spirit since the beginning.
 b10:You simply became able to see me.

p4:
 b1:Noticing something once can be a big deal.
 b2:Y- yeah...
 b3:If I had been mistaken for an enemy, this boy's power could've erased me!
 b4:I'm more relieved now that you are able to see me though.
 b5:W- well, It seems this world is more dangerous than I originally thought...
 b6 Waa?!
 b7:Did a demon just hit the train?
 b8:It's like there are small and large demons all over the place out there.

p5:
 b1:Dannoura-san.
 b2:Wh- What is it?!

p6:

p7:
 b1:UWAAAAA!!
 b2:KYAAA!
 b3:eh...?!
 b4:Is that a demon too?!
 b5:Sensed some killing intent.
 b6:I wonder what... I doubt we're being targeted.

p8:
 b1:A notice to all passengers.
 b2:It appears a Sage has entered combat with an Aggressor nearby.
 b3:On grounds of official wartime regulations, all freight and carriage contracts are hereby voided.
 b4:For refunds on tickets...
 b5:How should we even interpret that?
 b6:'Whatever happens, not our problem,' I guess?
 b7:They won't even help us evacuate?!

p9:
 b1:It seems the train staff aren't too worried about the passengers.
 b2:Are you hurt anywhere?!
 b3:Ah, from earlier...!
 b4:We should get out of here!
 b5:Excuse us, we'll be heading out first.
 b6:Everyone seems to be getting off the train.
 b7:Are we also going to...

p10:
 b1:...Ah!
 b2:That's... a robot!
 b3:On that mountain!
 b4:eh?
 b5:I guess that's the Aggressor.
 b6:Where's the sage then...
 b7:Isn't it that guy over there?

p11:

p12:
 b1:I can't even see that far.
 b2:Don't underestimate the physical abilities of those of House Dannoura.
 b3:The Dannoura House is regularly winning over the blood of famous people like Nobunaga Oda and Enchou Sanyuutei!
TN:Oda- famous daimyo, Sanyuutei- famous writer
 b4:Since when?!

p13:

p14:

p15:
 b1:I see...
 b2:Although the two can avoid eachother's attacks,
 b3:they seem to disregard where these attacks land.
 b4:I guess the sage's energy blasts are what destroyed the train.
 b5:Well this is problematic. Escaping from here looks a bit difficult.

p16:
 b1:What? Aren't you going to take care of those two!?
 b2:Why would I?
 b3:EHH?
 b4:...because...they're in our way?
 b5:In that case, would it be fine to kill people walking slowly in front of traffic?
 b6:But... weren't we almost killed by that flying thing?
 b7:Yeah, but it's not like they were targeting us.

p17:
 b1:I feel like if you don't draw a strict line, 
 b2:you'll end up killing people just because they slightly bother you.
 b3:I'd rather avoid that.
 b4:ah...
 b5:Err, sorry then. I guess that was pretty naive of me.
 b6:I'm not blaming you, don't worry about it.
 b7:Anyway, avoiding their attacks shouldn't be too difficult, so if we just proceed carefully??

p18:
 b1:Eeeee!
 b2:The Aggressor!
 b3:Run! Get away from it!

p19:
 b1:Damn it!
 b2:Stop running!
 b3:Sage-sama!
 b4:It's Sage Santarou-sama!
 b5:Huh? Who're you guys?

p20:
 b1:Dannour-san, step back.
 b2:eh
 b3:eee...
 b4:GYAAAA!

p21:
 b1:How cruel...!
 b2:Why...!
 b3:ah?
 b4:Why'd you dodge it!
 b5:Why did you attack over here?
 b6:Isn't that guy your opponent?
 b7:If I may ask.
 b8:Haa?!
 b9:Did you just talk to me?!
 b10:Don't you have a duty to grovel before me?!
 b11:You damn eyesore!

p22:
 b1:In that case, I guess it's fine.
 b2:You're
 b3:the eyesore here.

p23:
 b1:Y- you killed him?
 b2:Yeah.
 b3:Clear call if you ask me.
 b4:Eliminating those who attack needlessly...right?
 b5:Then, how about that Robo over there...
 b6:True.
 b7:Should I attack first...?
 b8(robot font):Wait!

p24:
 b1(robot font):I have no intention to fight.

roboto font:bauhaus 93
