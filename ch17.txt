p1:
 b1:...Hey! Leave immediately!
 b2:What's wrong mokomoko-san?!
 b3:Do you not notice this miasma?
 b4:Up headed is... something evil!
 b5:Up head... isn't it just a tower?
 b6:I don't know about this stuff but... Takatou-kun?
 b7:bleeegh
 b8:Rainier-san?!
 
p2:
 b1:Are you okay?! stay strong!
 b2:He got hit by the maisma.
 b3:miasma?
 b4:will i be okay then...
 b5:I am protecting you.
 b6:And it seems the young man can prevent it himself.
 b7:It seems that you're able to endure this maisma, rainier-san.
 b8:rick-san!
 b9:Something of this level won't affect me but...
 b10:takatou-kun...
 b11:Indeed... ever since the barrier, there have been some shadows of death.
 b11:But it's not immediately dangerous...
 b12:waa?!
 b13:fwuu...
 b14:I was able to gain resistance thanks to the stones!
 b15:Is this really a situation to use something like that?!
 
p3:
 title:Won't it solve everything if I just kill him
 
p4:
 b1:Is it really fine to enter this tower?
 b2:Atila...
 b3:huh? atila?
 b4:Can she not come with us?
 b5:She was blocked by the barrier.
 b6:From there on, it seems to allows people who are taking the trial...
 b7:ehhh...
 b8:Are we seriously taking the trial...
 b9:This is getting even more annoying.
 
p5:
 b1:That door in the center is where we're headed.
 b2:waa...
 b3:The tower is very wide on the inside.
 b4:Hey, hurry up or we'll leave you!
 b5:It's not like I really care if you do...
 b6:This is an elevator?
 b7:Even though it's a fantasy-style tower.
 b8:Well, it's better than having to climb the stairs.
 
p6:
 b1:We're on the roof.
 b2:Come over and look on this side.
 b3:eh...
 b4:no way...!
 
p7:
 b1:Indeed.
 b2:This is the end of the world.
 
p8:
 b1:hmm...?!
 b2:What can you see dannoura-san?
 b3:In the middle of that monster cluster...
 b4:Is a man in black and woman in white...?
 b5:The woman's sword...seems to be piercing both of them, but they are frozen.
 
p9:
 b1:amazing
 b2:I can only see a huge sphere of monsters.
 b3:That might be the holy king and devil!
 b4:Isn't the surrounding sphere a barrier?
 b5:It isn't wrong to say that this world is at its end.
 b6:It's just barely staying alive.
 b7:Even the sword saint is just a simple guard in the face of this.
 b8:I already knew all that!
 b9:I'm here to finally put an end to this thousand year battle with the devil!
 b10:Won't it solve everything if I just kill him!
 b11:Frederica-san!
 b12:You know her?
 
p10:
 b1:houu
 b2:you're high spirited.
 b3:hehe! Your role will end today!
 b4:You'll be able to retire peacefully after this!
 b5:Sunburst Flare...!!

p11:
 b1:waah
 b2:Tha person did that so suddenly?!
 b3:Fredrica-san!
 b4:fufu...
 
p12:
 b1:With this, the devil and all his followers will be finished!
 b2:I will defeat the devile thate even the holy king coudn't beat and finally restore the peace!
 b3:So...
 
p13:
sfx:freeze
 b1:huh?
 b2:The flow of time inside the barrier is slowed.
 b3:And it's slowest at the center.
 b4:It will take hundreds of years before that attack reaches the devil.
 
p14:
 b1:So that's why...I can't simply retire peacefully.
 b2:We will now start the knight of the holy king selection trial.
 b3:Please listen to the detailed explanation.
 b4:WEll then.
 b5:The flow of time here is slowed due to the effects of the barrier.
 b6:So, the time on the outside will be sluggish and greatly different.
 b7:Now then, everyone please pay attention.
 b8:I am the magic doll in charge of managing this trial.
 b9:There are other machines of the same model working inside the tower as well.
 
p15:
 b1:I ask that everyone aim to get to the first floor of this tower within 24 hours.
 b2:This roof is on the hundredth floor.
 b3:However, to pass, you need to collect 100 points while in the tower.
 b4:Would jumping from here to the ground result in failure?
 b5:Of course. The same goes for using the elevator.
 b6:As for a hint on collecting points in the tower.
 b7:Please find out for yourself.
 b8:hmm... well
 b9:So boring. (dull,sluggish)
 b10:...takatou-kun
 b11:Doesn't that person stand out?
 b12:They weren't in the square.
 b13:It seems like there's more people...
 
p16:
 b1:This tower has two types of rooms.
 b2:Have you noticed how the rooftop floor is white? That's because this is a "safe area".
 b3:Combat in the safe areas will result in immediate disqualification.
 b4:However, there are the "battle areas" with gray floors.
 b5:If you as a magic doll for your point count, they will answer.
 b6:That's all for the explanation.
 b7:The trial will begin starting now.
 b8:Please challenge whichever entrance you prefer.
 b9:Is a question alright?
 b10:That's fine, but hasn't the trial already started?
 
p17:
 b1:well
 b2:The woman in the maid outfit over there in the roaring sword rank, teresa-dono...basically, she is a former servant of the holy king, but...
 b3:Why is she participating in the selection?
 b4:ara, richard-san.
 b5:How strange to meet in such a place.
 b6:Teresa-dono...
 b7:I was careless enough to get tricked.
 b8:Thus, I was disqualified from the holy king's knight selection.
 b9:So, I asked the sword saint if I could try again.
 b10:There are several special participants including her.
 b11:There are various reasons...
 b12:I see... so the number of people increased along the way.
 b13:There are also other people to be worried about...
 
p18:
 b1:Skull mask...
 b2:The magician man in the golden robe...
 b3:The Japanese man with the girls...
 b4:An that girl too...
 b5:I feel like she is hiding something.
 b6:Surely, that person is somehow strong...
 b7:You'll have to be more careful than ever before.
 b8:uhh... This is a bit troubling.
 b9:I'd like to just leave this place early and head to the capital city but...
 
p19:
 b1:I'll protect you guys as much as possible but...there are people here who I'd never be able to beat.
 b2:Teresa-dono from earlier is one of them...
 b3:If we meet them in the battle areas, we'll need to escape immediately.
 b4:They're that strong...
 b5:uhm...that girl from earlier who use magic...
 b6:Her name is Fredrica, she's the one who invited me...
 b7:Is it really fine to leave her alone then?
 b8:well.. the thing is...
 b9:That person... might be absent-minded right now but...
 b10:I think it would backfire if I were to attempt to console her right now...
 
p20:
 b1:So that's why...I didn't even know about the devil or holy king when I came here...
 b2:Didn't that kid say she was going to defeat the devil though...
 b3:I guess it wouldn't be easy to attack from outside the barrier.
 b4:...hm?
 b5:What about takatou-kun's ability?
 b6:He could probably kill the devil from outside the barrier...
 b7:no no
 b8:"Is there any reason to kill it?"
 b9:He'd probably say something like that.
 b10:I don't even know which one is the devil anyways.
 b11:Just because one might look more evil doesn't necessarily mean anything.
 b12:hey takat...
 
p21:
 b1:What's wrong?
 
p22:
 b1:well... you remember the miasma earlier...
 b2:The miasma was threatening so i reflexively killed the source of it, but...
 b3:It might have been... coming from there?
 b4:huh?
