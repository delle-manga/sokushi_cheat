==p1==


「十秒後に自分か死ぬ」
"I will die in 10 seconds."

天盤喰らいにはそれが決定された未来であるということしかわからなかった
All the heavenly record eater could comprehend was that its future had been decided.

なぜそんなことになるのか．．．
Why is this happening...

その意味が何もわからない
It simply couldn't understand what it meant.

疑問はかりが脳裏を埋め尽くし思考は空転した
Questions flooded its mind, but it couldn't formulate a thought.

ただ杲然として貴重な余命を五秒も消費した
In its confusion, it had already consumed five seconds of its precious remaining lifetime.

あと五秒．．．
そこから先の未来が見えない
Five seconds left... beyond that point, it was no longer able to see the future...


==p2==


自分の時間はそこで終わってしまっている
It knew that's where time ended for it.

天盤喰らいは
A heavenly record eater...

時間を操作した
...which could manipulate time.

数秒単位のことなら時間を通ることなど造作もない
If it's just a few seconds, then it's no big deal to travel through time.

十秒も戻れば死の原因が起こる前に防ぐこともできよう
Ten seconds would allow for it to prevent the cause of death before it ever happened...

死まであと十五秒
Making it fifteen seconds until death.


==p3==


十秒戻ったところで何も変わらないことを理解し異常に気づく
When it went back ten seconds, it realized that nothing had changed, but it did notice an anomaly.

天盤喰らいが自分の死に気付いたのが「十秒前」
It was "ten seconds ago" that the heavenly record eater noticed its death.

つまり死の原因が発生したのが死の十秒前のはずだ
In other words, the cause of death must have occured ten seconds before death.


==p4==


「十五秒前」に戻れば「十秒前」に起こるはずの死の因果からは解放されるのが道理だ
It's only logical that if you go back to "fifteen seconds ago", you should be free from the causality of death that was supposed to happen "ten seconds ago".

なのに間近に迫る「死」は
However, the imminent "death"...

天盤喰らいを捕らえて放さない
...had caught the heavenly record eater and wouldn't let go.

天盤喰らいは自意識が目覚めて以来
初めて恐怖した
For the first time since its awakening of consciousness...
...the heavenly record eater felt scared.

見えない何かが己の身に絡みついている
Something invisible had entangled itself within the heavenly record eater.

それは一切知覚できず
"It" was impossible to perceive.

振りほどく術がまるでわからない
And the heavenly record eater knew no way to shake it off.


==p5==


あまりにも理不目な「それ」は
That "thing" was too unreasonable.

因果すら越えていた
It was beyond causality.

壇ノ浦流の教え
Dannoura-style teachings


==p6==


過去に遡ろうと決定した事象を覆すことができない
Unable to overturn the events by going back in time...

天盤喰らいは
The heavenly record eater...

人としての身体を放棄した
...immediately abandoned its human body.

アルガンダ帝国の皇帝としての身体を天盤内へ放り出し
It left its body as the Emperor of the Arganda Empire in the heavenly record.

自らの本体へと意を戻したのた
It returned its will back to its original body.

「海」に漂う天盤をも飲み込めるほどの
The body which could consume a heavenly record in the "sea".

その本体で天盤喰らいは目覚めた
In that body, the heavenly record eater awoke.


==p7==


自分はちっぽけな人間などではないことを思いだし
It remembered that it was no longer a tiny human.

時の流れは曖昧となり全能感に満たされた
すると
Filled with omnipotence, the passage of time became ambiguous.

怒りが湧いてきた
Regardless, it became angry.

許せなくなったのだ
It couldn't allow such a thing to happen.

「この自分がおめおめと逃げ出した」
"I was the one that ran away shamelessly."

「こんな天盤など消え去れはいい」
"It would be best if this heavenly record were to disappear."

怯え恐れた自分を糊塗するかのように激情で心を埋めくし
As if to cover up its frightened and fearful state, the heavenly record eater filled itself with rage.

天盤に向かってその巨大な口を広げ...
It spread its massive mouth toward the heavenly record...


==p8==


死ね
Die

その瞬間
At that moment...

何かが聞こえた気がして天盤喰らいは気付いた
The heavenly record eater thought it heard something and then came to a realization.

今が
死を悟ってから「十秒後」なのだと
"Right now" was...
ten seconds after realizing it would die.


==p9==


天盤喰らいは
最後に
The heavenly record eater, in the end...

自我になど目覚めなければよかったと考えた
...wished that it had never awakened to its ego.


==p10==


壇ノ浦さん
Dannoura-san

俺ちょっと眠くなってきたし寝るよ
I'm getting a little sleepy, so I'm gonna take a nap.

あっ　うん
ah, sure.

ここまでかなり「カ」を使ってたもんね
...You've used your "power" quite a bit after all.

おそらく危険地帯は抜けたようだしな
It looks like we're probably outside the danger zone for now.

王都まではやって来たものの
Even though we've come all the way to the royal capital...

本当に元の世界に帰る方法なんて見つかるのかな?
Will we really be able to find a way to return to our original world here?

最悪の場合この世界で暮らしていかなきやいけなくなるかも...
In the worst case, we might have to learn to live in this world...


==p11==


その場合って
どうなるんだろう
I wonder what we would do in that case...

お金や貴金属は十分持ち合わせがあるけど
We have plenty of money and precious metals, but...

問題はこの世界の治安だよね
the main problem with this world is safety...

実際
高遠くんがいなかったら
In fact, if it weren't for Takatou-kun...

どうしょうもない状況ばっかりだったし．．．
I would have been helpless in many situations...

うーん．．．
hmm...

この寝顔何もかもを殺すような存在とはとても思えないんだけどな．．．
Looking at his sleeping face, you would never consider he's an existence which could instantly kill anything...


==p12==


もし帰れなければこのまま小僧と暮らせばよかろうが！
If you can't go home, you should definitely live with the youngster!

うわあ！！
Uwaah!!

って　何？！
もこもこさん心でも読めんの？！
What?! Can you read minds, Mokomoko-san?!

お主．．．
自分が実にわかりやすい人間だという自覚はあるか?
Are you not aware that you're a really easy-to-read person?

悪かったね!
Well my bad for being easy!!

ふむ
まあ小僧でも悪くはないがな
Hmm well, the youngster isn't particularly bad.

少なくとも見た目はよい壇ノ浦の血に取り入れるのもいいだろう
At least his appearance is nice. It might be a good idea to mix him into the Dannoura bloodline.

いきなり何言っちゃってんの?!
What are you saying all of the sudden?!

おかしいか?
戻れぬならこの地で一族の血脈を保っしかなかろうが
What's the problem? If you can't go back to your original world, shouldn't you preserve the Dannoura bloodline in this world?

それとも他に好いておる男でもおるのか?
Or do you have another man in your life already?

いやそれは別こいないんだけどさ．．．
No, that's not the case, but...

けど高遠くんにも選ぶ権利が
But, do I have the right to choose takatou-kun...


==p13==


小僧の方も憎からず思っておるはずだがな
I'm sure the youngster feels the same way about you.

直接聞いてみてはどうだ？
Why don't you just ask him directly?

んん．．．
他に選択肢がない状況でなんとなく付き合うとかさ．．．
Well, if I were to date him out of necessity as if I had no choice...

なんか事務的すぎてロマンかなくない?
I feel like there would be no passion and it would be impractical?

私はちょっとなあ．．．
I'm not sure...

あっ あれかな?
王都の入口
Ah, is that it? The capital's entrance.

王都へ向かう鉄道もすでに動いておるようだな
It seems like the railroad to the royal capital is functional again too.

クラスの人たち もう先に付いてるかもね...
Our classmates might have already arrived...

んん．．．
Hmmn

今どこ？
壇ノ浦さん
Where are we, Dannoura-san?

あっ　起きた?
今王都入口に着いたとこだよ
Ah, you woke up? We just arrived at the royal capital's entrance.

誰か近付いて来てるけど衛兵かな?
Someone is approaching, do you think it's the guards?

駅や平原にいた奴らとは違うみたいだけど...
Their outfits are different from the guys at the station and plains, but still...


==p14==


え うわ
大丈夫かな?
eh, will we be fine?

今のところ殺気は感じないけど...
I don't sense any killing intent at the moment, but...

一応調べられたりするのかな
it's likely they're just here to investigate.

それで穏便に入れるならその方がいいんだけど...
I'm fine with it as long as we can get in peacefully...

こんにちは
私は南中央門の警備責任者でトルクスと申します
Hello, my name is Torx and I'm the chief security officer of the southern central gate.

すみませんが車から降りていくつかご質問をよろしいですか?
Excuse me but, may you step out of the car and answer a few questions?

どうしよう?
What do we do?

まあ...
とりあえずは従うしかないかな．．．
Well, we should just follow along for now...


==p15==


私の記憶に間違いがなければ
If my memory serves me correctly...

この車両は不死機団のものかと思うのですが...
This vehicle belongs to the Immortality Corps, doesn't it...

ああ...
そういえばこれ元々あの人たちの車だっけ
yeah, now that you mention it, this vehicle was originally theirs.

評判よくなさそうだよね．．．
It's unlikely they have a good reputation...

俺たちは不死機団じゃないよ
We're not part of the Immortality Corps.

この車は ハナブサの領主 リョウタさんに もらったんだ
This car was given to us by Ryouta, the city lord of Hanabusa.

ふむ．．．
どちらにせよ賢者レイン様の関係者ということですね?
Hm... that means you're connected to Sage Lain-sama in some way, right?

えーと．．．
困ったな
well... it's a bit confusing.

俺たち賢者シオン様の賢者候補なんだ
We are sage candidates of Sage Sion-sama.

試練のために王都へ来たんだけど．．．
We came to the royal capital for the trials...

あ...
そうだ
Oh yeah...

このペンダントリックさんにもらったけど王都の人なら見てもらったら．．．
Rick-san said to show this pendant if we ran into trouble at the royal capital...


==p16==


それは...
リチャード様のアミュレット!!
This is Richard-sama's amulet!!

えっ？！
Ehh?!


==p17==


え．．．？
Uhm...?

えーと
なんなんだろこれ
Well, it seems this is something important...

てかリックさん何者？
But wait, who is this Rick-san?

それは王家の紋章が刻まれたアミュレットです
That is an amulet with the royal crest engraved on it.

王威が込められており王家に忠誠を誓った者に命を伝えるのです
It's only given to those who've sworn allegiance to the royal family.

直に拝見する必要はありますが我々が見誤ることはありえません
I'll need to take a closer look, but there is no way this can be faked.


==p18==


じゃあ
通してもらえるの?
Then, can we get through with this?

もちろん．．．
Of course...

ちょっと待ってくれないかな?
Can you wait for just a moment?

何か勘違いしているようだけど
I think you are misunderstanding something...

そのアミュレットは王家の者の意志を伝えるものであって
That amulet only conveys the will of a person from the royal family...

衛兵を黙らせるようなものではないよ？
But, it can't just silence the guards, you know?

そうなの？
Is that so?

は．．．はい
我らか跪いたのはリチャード様への敬意を表したまでで
Y-yes, we knelt simply to show respect to Richard-sama.

アミュレットか何をしても許される免罪符のような物とはお考えにならないで下さい
So please don't misunderstand the amulet as a luxury that allows you to do as you please.


==p19==


僕の名は デイヴィッド
My name is David.

王家の末席に連なる者だ
I hold the lowest seat in the royal family.

だから別にリチャードに気兼ねする必要は感じないね
Therefore, I don't feel the need to worry about conflicting with Richard.

ディヴィッド!
失礼であろうが!
David! You're being impolite!

僕は副隊長だよ?
トルクス隊長
I'm the deputy captain, aren't I, Captain Torx?

隊長の判断がおかしければ諫める義務があるだろう?
Is it not my job to warn you when I think your judgement is wrong?

確かにそのアミュレットはリチャードの手によるもので
Certainly, that amulet comes from Richard.

二つのメッセージを伝えている
And it conveys two messages.

一つは 「彼らに王都での便宜を図ってほしい」
The first is "give these two accomodations in the capital".

そっちはまいいさ
That part I have no problem with.


==p20==


けれどもう一つはことなんだ?
But, what is the other meaning?

「このニ人は聖王の騎士だ」...というのは?
Could it mean that "these two are knights of the holy queen"?

確かに私たち塔の一階に到着したから聖王の騎士に合格しちゃったことになってるんだっけ．．．?
It is true that we reached the first floor of the tower, so I guess we must have passed the trial to become knights of the holy queen...?

その後すぐリックさんが新しい剣聖になって別れ際にこれをくれたんだよ
Shortly after that, Rick-san became the new Sword Saint and gave me this before we separated.

は！　語るに落ちたね!
Ha! I've caught you in your lies!

リックが剣聖?
馬鹿を言うなよな!
Rick-san is the Sword Saint? Don't say such stupid things!

そう言われてもなあ．．．
Even if you say so...

本当なんだけど．．．
It's true though...


==p21==


証明してみせてくれよ
Prove it to me.

聖王の騎士だってなら剣の腕前でさ
If you're truly knights of the holy queen, then show me your sword skills.

ディヴィッド！
どういうつもりだ！
David! What are your intentions!!

確かめるには簡単だろ?
僕に負けるような奴か聖王の騎士なわけがないんだから
Isn't it easy to prove? Anyone who loses to me couldn't possibly be a knight of the holy queen.

さ　どうする？
So, what will you two do?

これは．．．
どうしたもんかな
This is... I don't know what we should do.

なーに！
知千佳が戦えばよいではないか
What do you mean! Won't it be fine if Tomochika fights him?

え？！
Eh?!

剣からビームが出るような人たちに勝てるわけないでしょ！！
Ah, of course! I definitely stand a chance against people who can shoot beams out of their swords!!

大丈夫だ
あの男の剣からビームは出ぬぞ！
You will be fine. Beams won't fire out of this guy's sword!

あまりにもいつも小僧に頼りきりではいかんと思わぬか?
Don't you think we shouldn't try to burden the youngster with everything?

そ...それは
そうだけどさ
W-well, I guess that's true.

あ!　あのロホットからもらった武器は使えるかな？
Oh! Should I use that weapon I got from the robot?


==p22==


今回はあれを使うまでもないわ
You don't need to use that this time.

あの男なら元の世界の人間と大して変わらん
That guy isn't much different from regular people back in our original world.

車にあった小太刀を使え
Use this kodachi I got from the car.

壇ノ浦流で充分通用するということだ
The Dannoura Style works well with these too.

隊長さん
こっちか勝ったら聖王の騎士と認めて王都に入れてくれるってことでいい?
Captain-san, if she wins this, we'll be recognized as knights of the holy queen and be allowed entry to the capital, right?

それは．．．もちろんです
Of course.

私としてはリチャード様のアミュレットだけでも十分なのですが．．．
For me, you guys having Richard-sama's amulet is good enough...

副隊長か異議を唱えている以上無理も通せず．．．
But since the deputy captain is in disagreement, I can't just let it go...

王家の血縁とか色々複雑そうなこと言ってたもんね．．．
He said he's part of the royal bloodline and such things, so I guess you're in a tough spot as well...

じゃあ私がデイウィッドさんに勝ったらでいいよね?
Well, we're good as long as I beat David-san right?

はい
Yes

もしもの場合は俺が力を使うけど．．．
And just in case, I have my power...

心配無用だ
Don't worry.

知千佳にもい機会だから極力邪魔はせんでくれ
This is a great opportunity for Tomochika, so try to avoid interfering.

さて
そろそろ始めたいんだがいいかな?
Now then, shall we get started?

おい
誰か合図をしてくれ!
Hey, someone give a signal!


==p23==


では
対戦者はこちらへ！
他の者は下がれ
Alright then, make way for the opponents! Everyone else, stand back.

一対一で戦い他の者は手出しをしない
This will be a one-on-one fight, so no one should interfere.

勝敗はどちらかの戦闘不能もしくは降参で決する
The loser will be determined when they are no longer able to fight or surrender.

...が 何も殺し合いをする必要はない
...however, there's no need for killing.

私が勝負ありと判断すれば止めるそれでいいな?
I'll stop the fight once I've decided the winner, alright?


==p24==


では
始め！
Now then
Begin!


==p25==


ふむ
相手方は西洋剣術で言う屋根の構えに似とるな
Hmm, the opponent looks like he's using a roof stance* of western's swordsmanship.

相手も自信ありげだけど勝てるもんなの?
The opponent looks confident, but can he beat her?

相手は正統派っぱいけど壇ノ浦流は違うよね
So the other party is orthodox, but the Dannoura Style is different, I guess.

ほう？
興味があるか小僧？
Oh? Are you interested in the Dannoura Style, youngster?

いいだろう教えてやろうではないか
Alright, let me teach you.

壇ノ浦流のモットーは卑怯上等だ!
とにかく奇をてらえ！ だ
The motto of the Dannoura Style is that coward moves are first-class techniques! Fighting in a strange way!

殺し合いで正々堂々など馬鹿のすることだ死んでは何も残らんからな！
Killing each other fairly is for idiots, since it's all over once you're dead!

それだと
壇ノ浦さんはあんまり向いてないんじゃない?
In that case, Dannoura-san doesn't seem very well suited, right?

今までの行動を見てると．．．
Based on how she's acted so far...


==p26==


うむ
あやつは心根が素直だからな
Hmm, because she is naturally docile.

だが後継者と見込んでおるにはわけが
However, there's a reason she's anticipated as the successor...

む．．．
状況が動きそうだ
Things are about to begin.

にらみ合ってるだけに見えるけど．．．
It looks like they're just staring at each other...

敵はリーチを活かして突っ込んできたら剣を振り下ろすつもりだろう
The opponent seems like he's going to use his reach defensively, and when she comes at him, he will swing his sword down.

だから動く必要はない
So he doesn't need to move.

...だが知千佳はもう動いておるぞ?
...but, it seems Tomochika is already moving?

えっ？
ehh?

左足は敵から見えぬよう隠して立ち
She's standing with her left foot hidden from her opponent.

少しずつ動かして間合いを詰め伸ばした小太刀は逆に引いておる
She's slowly moving closer while retracting the kodachi, keeping it in the same place.

地味だが間合いを見誤らせる嫌らしい手口でな
It's simple, but a nasty trick to cause your opponent to misjudge the distance.

そろそろだ
...It's time.


==p27==


相手のまばたきに合わせて
As the opponent goes to blink...

小太刀をほんの少し上に投げて滞空させ
Toss the kodachi upward slightly to let it stay in the air.

同時に脱力して前に倒れ
At the same time, fall forward as if you're exhausted...


==p28==


地面を蹴り滑るように間合いを詰める
at the last moment, push forward like the beginning of a sprint.

左手で敵の膝裏を払い反動を利用して身体を起こす
Using your left hand, strike the back of the opponent's knee, and use that pressure to reorient yourself.

これで敵の構えに隙を作り...
This will create a gap in the opponent's stance to stabilize...

背後からその隙を突く...!!
which you will take advantage of from behind!


==p29==


「予想外の行動で敵を欺け」
"Deceive the opponent with unexpected behaviour."

「戦うなら最も卑怯な手段を見出し躊躇なく行え」
"If you are going to fight, find the most cowardly way to do so and never hesitate!"

これが壇ノ浦流の教えリ!!
These are the Dannoura Style teachings!!

ん？
huh?

速すぎてよくわからなかった．．．
It was too fast for me to follow...

縮地もどきだな
It was a pseudo-shukuchi move.

あの男には知千佳が消えたように見えたことだろう
To that man, it looked like Tomochika disappeared.


==p30==


私の勝ち
It's my win.

．．．じゃないならとどめを刺すけど？
...or should I stab him to finish it?

勝負あり！
It's her victory!
