p1:
 b1:Wa...
 b2:Wait a minute please!!
 b3:eh?
 b4:Is it possible... that this...
 b5:Was this your doing?
 b6:Yeah.
 b7:It was me.
 
p2:
 b1:I'm sorry if this is an inconvenient request, but...
 b2:Can you please help me!
 b3:ehh
 b4:What should I do?
 b5:eh?! don't push it on me.
 b6:Well, you could at least listen to what she has to say...
 
p3:
 b1:Silence in the Tower (The Tower's Silence)
 
p4:
 b1:My name is Theodisia.
 b2:I'm Takatou Togiri.
 b3:I'm Dannoura Tomochika.
 b4:What do you need help with?
 b5:I'm guessing it's not about the trial...
 text:You've gotten this far alone after all...
 b6:You're correct.
 b7:I'm looking for my missing younger sister.
 b8:Somewhere in this tower... I came here because I felt like she might be imprisioned underground, but...
 b9:Now that my disguise has been see through, I don't think I'll be able to save her myself without getting captured.
 b10:Wai... Wait a minute?!
 
p5:
 b1:We are Japanese and not familiar with this world...
 b2:Why are you guys being imprisoned?
 b3:Yeah, it would be helpful it you explained even the common sense stuff.
 b4:Ah... my apoligies.
 b5:Do you about how people use the derogatory term "half-devil" in reference to people like me?
 sfx: shaking head (nope)
 b6:Having silver hair and brown skin.
 b7:As well as having immense magic power.
 b8:However, most of the clans don't have the talent to use magic. And I'm one of them...
 b9:I guess just having magic power doesn't mean you can use it.
 b10:Didn't something fly out of Theodisia-san's sword in the fight though?
 b11:Wasn't that magic?
 b12:That was just swordsmanship?
 b13:In what universe?!
 
p6:
 b1:Having magic may be useless to us, but it's still a rare treasure.
 b2:To those who scheme to use magic power for something, we are easy sources of that power. 
 b3:Easy to use...?
 b4:If my people are trapped in this tower...
 b5:I fear that it's likely they are being used as livestock for their magic...
 b6:How awful...!
 b7:We just met with Iglacia...
 b8:He was saying something about how the tower's existance is to maintain the barrier.
 b9:If it's true, then your story is quite possible.
 b10:In other worlds, you want us to help save your people?
 b11:That's right.
 b12:Now that I'm in my half-demon form, I won't be able to move freely inside the tower.
 b13:If I make a wrong move, then I'll be caught and end up like my compatriots.
 
p7:
 b1:But if it's with the help of you two...
 b2:I know it's a selfish request, but...
 b3:Can't you just disguise yourself again?
 b4:That was magic I asked a friend to cast on me.
 b5:I'm only able to dispel it with my power...
 b6:Either way, I don't think the Sword Saint will find you since the tower can't monitor inside anymore.
 b7:ah... it's because we've been progressing and destroying parts of the tower on the way.
 b8:We just have to watch out for the sword saint and the magic dolls...
 b9:However, if we find the half-demons and you ask me to catch one of them, I'm going to complain.
 sfx:yup yup
 b10:That's...
 b11:Does that mean you are willing to help me?
 b12:Even though it means you'll be disqualified from the trial and probably considered hostile to the sword saint...
 
p8:
 b1:We just got caught up in all this on our way to the royal capital.
 b2:It's fine since we weren't trying to become Knights of the Holy King anyways.
 b3:Are you fine with this, Dannoura-san?
 b4:Yeah, she doesn't seem like a bad person.
 b5:...But
 b6:I was thinking that these types of things would be annoying to you, Takatou-kun.
 b7:Why's that.
 b8:If you're asked to help, isn't it normal to help.
 b9:Ah! Certainly!
 b10:After all, I haven't seen you refuse a request from anyone!
 text:Please!
 b11:I mean, there's usually no time for discussion because we just get suddenly attacked.
 b12:...In the first place
 b13:You were the first one to help me since coming to this world.
 b14:...hm?
 
p9:
 b1:...No way!
 b2:Boobs! It's because the boobs!
 b3:Breasts?
 b4:If you look close, her's are quite good!!
 b5:...Ah! These?
 b6:It's pretty cheap if all I have to do to get your help is pay with my body.
 b7:Do as you like.
 b8:Can you stop with that standard plot development?!
 b9:We're not looking for you body or anything!!
 b10:Yeah
 b11:I have my preferences.
 
p10:
 b1:Regardless, I can't just take Theodisia's word for it.
 b2:I'll think about what to do depending on the the situation, is that alright?
 b3:Of course. I'm in no position to make demands since I'm the one requesting help.
 b4:No matter you're judgment, I won't complain.
 b5:Well, first off. You're friends are in the basement, right? Let's head there.
 b6:Then eventually exit this tower.
 b7:Yeah...
 b8:I just hope the Sword Saint is open to discussion...
 b9:I'm sure Theodisia-san would want to help her friends regardless what happens to the sword saint, but...
 b10:With Takatou-kun's ability...
 b11:Defending yourself means the death of the attacking opponent.
 
p11:
 b1:The moment the opponent has the intention to attack...
 b2:Takatou-kun's ability will kill them.
 b3:No matter how important their existence is to this world, it can't be stopped...
 b4:Ahh... hey!
 b5:If you keep screwing around, we won't make it in time!!
 b6:huh...
 b7:That's... Rick-san! Rainier-san?! And that girl...
 b8:Dannoura-san! It's good to see that you're safe.
 
p12:
 b1:I came across Fredrica-san and Rainier-san collecting points...
 b2:I finished collecting mine a long time ago!
 b3:Rainier didn't collect any at all, so I was helping him!
 b4:Rainier-san, I'm glad you're okay...
 b5:I did the most expensive gacha and managed to get a rare armour with good defense.
 b6:I barely avoided getting fatally stabbed multiple times thanks to Fredrica-san's abilities...
 b7:And thanks to her, I managed achieve 100 points.
 text:There were so many times I thought I was going to die...
 b8:The time limit for the trial is almost over, so let's get going.
 b9:Come to think of it, it is that time already.
 b10:Down this way is the first floor of the tower... which should be the goal.
 
p13:
 b1:Ah! This room...
 b2:It's the hall from when we entered.
 b3:We're back at the entrance.
 b4:It's time.
 b5:...Now then, it looks like seventeen people passed.
 
p14:
 b1:Now that you're all knights of the holy king...
 b2:Sword Saint-sama!!
 b3:It's an emergency!
 b4:The tower has gone silent!
 b5:We don't know what's going on.
 b6:Is that all?
 b7:According to visual confirmation, there is also something wrong with the barriers.
 b8:We're having difficulty maintaining the first barrier.
 b9:And fluctuations have begun to occur on the edge of the second barrier.
 b10:The predicted time that the followers break through the barrier is changing...
 
p15:
 b1:Wh... What?!
 b2:This shaking...!!

p16:
 b1:...huh?
 
p17:
 b1:...What
 b2:Is this...
 b3:Where did the rest of the tower go...?
 
p18:
 b1:hmm
 b2:I thought that if I destroyed the tower, the barrier would disappear, but...
 
p19:
 b1:I guess it isn't that simple.
 
p20:
 b1:uh... ah...
 b2:...What an overwhelming miasma...
 b3:Even his followers have this kind of power...!
 b4:...I was told you wouldn't break through for another three days.
 b5:Well, its fine. You guys...
 b6:As Knights of the Holy King, this is your first job.
 b7:Defeat that thing which came out of the barrier.
 b8:eh...
 b9:We're supposed to face that thing all of a sudden...?!
 
p21:
 b1:If we don't defeat it, then humanity is finished.
 
p22:
 b1:Okay.
 b2:Let's find a way into the basement while we can.
 b3:eh?!
 b4:I agree.
 b5:ehhh?!
 b6:Wait?! Is it fine to leave that thing?!
 b7:It's giving of the last boss aura!!
 b8:I don't think it's any of our business though...
 b9:If we defeat it, we might catch the interest of the sword saint.
 b10:It's best not to get involved in such things!
 
p23:
 b1:I'm sorry, but I'm going underground alone if I have to!
 b2:Theodisia-san!
 b3:We should go too, Dannoura-san.
 b4:ehh
 b5:what?!
 b6:Perhaps we should also flee...?!
 b7:Hmph! It's useless to be a coward!
 b9:Concentrate Rainier-san! Prepare your stones!
 b10:...Your oppenent is a monster who can instantly erase a hundred-story tower.
 b11:Even if you ran away..
 b12:Hiiee...
 b13:It's an opponent you can't escape!
 
p24:
 b1:...How can I remove the barrier?
 b2:If you tell me, I'll spare your life.
 
p25:
 b1:One of my status prevention rings...
 text:4 more though!
 b2:It seems to have tried to use mind control magic.
 b3:No matter how many stones I have, I won't be able to keep up...!
 b4:Well aren't you a very kind person.
 b5:You only destroyed the entire tower afterall.
 b6:I decided to destroy the tower because I thought it would break the barrier.
 b7:Since that didn't work though, I'm now exploring other methods.
 
p26:
 b1:Let's not be impatient though.
 b2:I'll kill you one by one until someone feels like giving me the answer.
 b3:Don't fuck with me!
 b4:hmm
 
p27:
 b1:Splitting yourself...
 b2:Will only mean that the number of corpses increases to six.
 b3:The split bodies weren't an afterimage but actual bodies?!
 b4:Rainier, you're weak, so get down!
 b5:I don't know if my magic will hit just him.
 b6:Fredrica-san, you're gonna use your magic?!
 
p28:
 b1:If he's outside the barrier, then there's nothing to protect him!
 b2:Eat this! Full Power!!
 b3:Hyper-Compressed Extreme Light Burst!!
 
p29:
 b1:...ha?!
 
p30:
 b1:That was pretty powerful for a human, I think...?
 b2:Sword Saint-sama! Another unique individual has already broken out!
 b3:Two monsters at the same time...? This is bad.
 b4:Such a case has never happened before...
 b5:Don't call me something like unique individual.
 b6:My name is Lute and the one with wings is Orugein.
 b7:Well, while it may be a short relationship, it's nice to meet you.
 

note0:manga chapter 24 should be 10/1
note1:end of manga23 = middle of WNv2ch17 (though the manga skips the beginning of WNv2ch17)
-note2:I went with the names chosen in the WN translation for the unique individuals (Ryu-tTo)Lute and (O-Ru-Ge-I-N)Orugein 
-note3:when translating some parts, such as the last bubble on page 5 where tomochika says "in what world?" and the raw says 
"dokoga?!" which directly TLs to something like "Where?!", i often try to consider the context of the story as well as what
its saying, but in cases like this its weird. her saying "in what world" doesnt really make sense if taken too literal
because they are in another world, but if just used as an idiom then its fine. Let me know if you noticed or you just read
it as is.
note4:Also, i felt i did the grammar bad in this chapter. did anyone also feel that way?
note5:the title should be "the tower's silence" in reference to pg14's "the tower has gone silent", but i thought 
"silence in the tower" just sounded and fit the chapter better :/
-note6:winged person, used thing instead of guy
