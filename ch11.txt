p1:
 b1:Master!!
 b2:Hey...!!
 b3:Recovery magic isn't working either...!!
 b4:No!! Don't die! Master!!
sfx:WAAAAAAAH
 b5:H-how can this...
 b6:The "Dominator" Tuuki Tachibana is dead...
 b7:The "slave" status that was placed on me has disappeared.
sfx:shudder
 b8:I've... been the minion of the man who attacked my village until now...

p2:
 b1:Stephanie... You're really crying for a man like this.
 b2:The control of the "Dominator" has already been released, hasn't it?
sfx:hic, sob, hic
 b3:Euphemia...
 b4:You were also from a half-demon city, right.
 b5:I was bought from the slave market by master.
 b6:Yet, I've been treated as if I wasn't a slave he bought.
 b7:That's...
 b7:I can't even be compared to other slaves...
 b8:*sigh* I get it.
 b9:We half-demons have a habit of desecrating on the corpses our enemies...
 b10:I'll drop it. You can have the corpse.
 b11:Well then, cya Stephanie...
 b12:eh?
 b13:Euphemia?! Where are you going?
 b14:First, I'll look for my family...
 b15:Then I'll restore my home which was destroyed by that man.
 b16:Goodbye.

p3:
 b1:Volume 2 is on sale!
 b2:Let’s look like Allies of Justice for just a little more!

p4:
sfx:step, step, step
 b1:Even though my village was attacked by that man...
 b2:I was being dispatched to various places as a slave due to that skill of the "Dominator".
 b3:I wonder if I'll be able to find them again...
sfx:crush
 b4:The mushrooms and mold in this area are all dried up...?
 b5:Also, wasn't the entrance covered in trees and grass...
sfx:*empty*, crumble
 b6:fwshh
 b7:Where is this light coming from...
 b8:Something's wrong
 b9:This bad feeling...
 b10:Something happened outside...?

p5:
 b1:There's...
 b2:nothing here...?
 b3:The entrance to the ruins... and everything around...
 b4:are all gone...?

p6: n/a

p7:
sfx:wind
 b1:That huge black shadow...
 b2:He just passed through here...?!
 b3:This isn't a monster of this world...
 b4:That's definitely... an aggressor!

p8:
 b1:...Hmm
 b2:This aggressor "Kurayami"...
 b3:...is a really bad match up for me.

p9:
 b1:Anything it touches instantly dries up and withers away...
 b2:It's outline is ambiguous and striking it feels as if I'm hitting mist.
 b3:It's moving, but does it even have a will...?
 b4:It doesn't react, so it even a living being in the first place? 

p10:n/a

p11:
 b1:...Same as last time, as expected.
 b2:I wither away the moment I touch it, but my vampire regeneration speed is faster.
 b3:However, Kurayami doesn't seem to have received any damage as well.
 b4:hmmm...
 b5:If I had a type of magic that uses small instruments like Santarou's, then it may be possible...
 b6: What should I do now...
 b7:...hm?
 b8:Is there something down there...?
 b9:A half-demon girl? She's still intact after Kurayami passed through here...
 b10:Interesting

p12:
 b1:Hanabusa City
 b2:You're Masaykui?! What are you doing here?!
 b3:Didn't Lain-sama entrust the city of Hanabusa to me?!
sfx:slam
 b4:Don't be mad at me, Ryouta.
 b5:Aren't we friends who both survived the sage candidacy under Lain?
 b6:Survived you say? Didn't you /b/die a long time ago!
 b7:Anyways, hurry up and get the undead out of the city!
 b8:Hey, calm down. I'm here on Lain's command.
 b9:In other words, I'm in charge and you have no right to refuse.
 b10:So, you're gonna cooperate with my /b/Undead Battalion.

p13:
 b1:L...lain-sama's?
 b2:What'd you mean by cooperation?
 b3:You don't have to do anything but give me the "key" of the city.
 b4:Then we'll have the townspeople help us out.
 b5:What the hell are you trying to do...?
 b6:It's nothing big.
 b7:/b/Simply searching for some people.
sfx:gyaaaa
 b8:Why is the city full of zombies...
 b9:Shouldn't the city be protected by the sages from outside enemies?!
 b10:I don't know either, but...

p14:
 b1:They're movement seems slow, so if we're careful, we can probably escape the city.
 b2:Shouldn't we save the citizens?
 b3:One or two people are fine but...
 b4:It's unlikely I could save the whole city in this situation...
 b5:Really though, it'd be best not to get involved.
 b6:Zombie Time
 b7:Has come to an end!!

p15:
 b1:The zombies stopped...?
 b2:Hanabusa residents! Can you hear me?
 b3:I am Masayuki, a servant of Sage Lain, and the commander of the undead battallion.
 b4:On orders of Sage Lain...
 b5:I've acquired the key to the city's barriers! No one can leave the city.
 b6:Incidentally, all the undead are also contained inside the barrier.
 b7:If you die now, you will join the undead battalion.
 b8:However! I'm very gracious.
 b9:Those who do not want to die will assist in seaching for some people withing the city!
 b10:Two people. A guy named Yogiri Takatou and a girl named Tomochika Dannoura.
 b11:They're both around seventeen, black haired, dark eyed, and Japanese. They also don't have any gifts.

p16:
 b1:The grace period is one hour!!
 b2:Bring those two two the city's central square within an hour!
 b3:Alive or dead, doesn't matter!
 b4:After one hour, the zombies will start moving again!!
 b5:Also, if you don't find and bring me those two...
 b6:The undead will not stop again!!
 b7:Until every single person becomes an undead!
 b8:ahahahahahaha!

p17:
 b1:Hey Masayuki!
 b2:What are you saying?! That's not what you told me.
 b3:oh? It's not that different.
 b4:I'm looking for someone on Lain's command.
 b5:You didn't say you would harm the residents!!
 b6:Are you an idiot, Ryouta?
 b7:If I just say to find some people, who's gonna really search.
 b8:Won't people start searching as if their lives depend on it now?
 b9:Well, it's not like I can find them in this town by myself, right?
 b10:wha...
 b11:You!
 b12:Do you even know if those two are in this city?!
 b13:Well, aren't I confirming that now?
 b14:Besides, if they're anywhere, this city is the most likely. Dont worry.
 b15:MasaYuki...!

p18:
 b1:That damn masayuki...
 b2:He really just wants to let his undead battalion go wild.
 b3:Damn...
 b4:Do you have any idea how hard it was to develop Hanabusa this far...!
 b5:There's a Japanese over here!
 b6:Grab anyone who has black hair!!
 b7:hiee...
 b8:This is worse than the zombies.
 b9:We can't escape without being found, huh.
 b10:And now, the train's no good either...

p19:
 b1:Still, why are we being chased?
 b2:hmm...
 b3:Well, I did kill one of the sages.
 b4:It's not going to be as safe from now on...
 b5:And it's going to be annoying to have to kill innocents.
 b6:Over there! Some Japanese!
 b7:Black hair too!
 b8:Don't let them escape!
 b9:Waaah
 b10:We'll kill and bring them with us.
 b11:Just like I said.
 b12:If you get closer, I'll kill you.

p20:
 b1:What are you waiting for?! Hurry up!
 b2:Fine! I'll do it myself!
 b3:Die.
 b4:This is the first time I’ve seen someone carry out their words to such a disgusting degree!
 b5:It’s funny they think I won’t kill them even though they approach with the intent to kill.
 b6:Did they think I wouldn't kill them because they're civilians...?
 b7:That guy, Masayuki, who was speaking a little while ago.
 b8:I may be able to negotiate with him directly if we head to the square.

p21:
 b1:Hanabusa Central Square
 b2:...oh?
 b3:What do we have here?

p22:
 b1:Are you masayuki?
 b2:Are we the ones you're looking for?
 b3:haha...
 b4:Among what I’ve seen up to now, is this the most fantasy-looking thing I wonder...
 b5:Are you Yogiri Takatou and Tomochika Dannoura?
 b6:Why are you so boooring!!
 b7:Did you perhaps decide to become the scapegoat for everyone in the city?
 b8:Was there such a reason?
text:instant reply
 b9:No no no, don’t deny it instantly! Let’s look like allies of justice for just a little more!

p23:
 b1:Well, then why.
 b2:If I kill you guys, then I have to end this game!
 b3:WE came to talk.
 b4:We want to go to the Imperial Capital and be taken there by train.
 b5:Could you fix the barrier in order to let us use the station?
 b6:Haa?!

p24:
 b1:hey, hey, hey!
 b2:are you an idiot?! are you stupid?!
 b3:Are you fully aware of things like your current situation and what you are requesting!!
 b4:I see. there needs to be transaction material if it’s a negotiation...
sfx:hmm...
 b5:If it's "I let you live", then how's that sound?
 b6:What is this talk! Do you want to die?! Haah!?
 b7:Whatever! Kill them!!
 b8:Tear those two to shreds!!
 b9:My "Immortality Corps", the undead army!!

p25:
 b1:Go ahead and try killing the undead which are already dead!
 b2:Die.
 b3t:Hyahahahaha... ha?
