p1:
 leftnote:The first volume is on sale!
 chName:The eyeball's besides the point

p2:
 b1:Wait.
 b2:I have no intention to fight.
 b3:A... a robot...!
 b4:Reminds me of the dragon with how unreal it feels.
 b5:It talked Takatou-kun!

p3:
 b1:Is there someone inside?
 b2:There are no passengers.
 b3:You're voice suddenly got cute?!
 b4:are you actually a girl riding a robot?
 b5:No, I'm autonomous.
 b6:To avoid battle, 
 b7:I chose this voice to gain the young male's favor.
 b8:That's scarily calculating!
 b9:The machine's quite reasonable because...
 b10:It understands the dangers of this youngster.
 b11:eh... but
 b12:Can Takatou-kun's ability even works on a robot?

p4:
 b1:I don't know how you percieve my existance...
 b2:But I consider myself to be alive.
 b3:Don't robots live and die as well?
 b4:They do?!
 b5:Looks like that's the assumption the robot's going with.
 b6:Avoiding a fight sounds good, but...
 b7:Why were you fighting with that sage over there?
 b8:I was only defending myself.
 b9:I assume he viewed me as a foreign enemy; they call us Aggressors, after all.

p5:
 b1:...Foreign Enemy?
 b2:Where are you from then?
 b3:From outside this world.
 b4:eh?!
 b5:Did you say...
 b6:Outside?!
 b7:Do you know how to return to your original world?!

p6:
 b1:Three days prior, Quens Town/Queens Street
 b2:Hmm.
 b3:Is this the survivor from the report?
 b4:Boss...! Mirielle...! Are you there?
 b5:Help me, my eyes, ears, and nose aren't working!
 b6:Yes, ma'am.
 b7:As you can see, we haven't been able to question him yet.
 dogman:Heeeey! Gya, gaa
 b8:We had to restrain him to keep him still...

p7:
 b1:HIIII?!/EEEH?!
 b2:Looks like it normally should... Interesting.
 b3:Yes.
 b4:I tried recovery magic, it didn't...
 b5:Uh?!
 b6:GYAAAAAA!
 b7:...work.

p8:
 b1:What are...?!
 b2:Sage Lain-sama!!
 b3:I'm the kind of person that's not convinced until they've taken a closer look themselves.

p9:
 b1:Heal!
 b2:uuu...
 b3:Ohh! A new eye appeared instantly!
 b4:As expected of Sage Lain-sama...!
 b5:I've never seen such strong healing magic.
 b6:What the hell just happened...
 b7:Fuck, I can't see...
 b8:Doesn't look like he can see. 
 b9:Despite his organ making a full recovery, it still doesn't work.
 b10:Hmm...

p10:
 b1:Then, how about this?
 b2:Shink. (Teeth popping out)
 b3:HIIII?!/EEEH?!
 b4:Lain-sama?!
 b5:Lain-sama is a vampire, were you not aware?
 b6:Lain-sama's class is Origin Blood. The highest rank among undeads.

p11:
 b1:Also called the Immortal Empress.
 b2:She's very different from your regular undead.
 b3:Is that so?
 b4:You seem quite knowledgeable about her.
 b5:Well, yeah.
 b6:That's because Lain-sama was a sage even when I was a candidate.
 b7:GUAAA
 b8:Those who are turned directly by Lain-sama should show drasticly improved physical function.

p12:
 sfx:stagger
 b1:Gaa...
 b2:uu...
 b3:...Hm
 b4:So even turning him into my blood won't do.
 b5:Telepathy isn't even working.
 b6:Interesting...
 b7:...What?! This shaking...

p13:
 sfx:battlecry
 b1:My...my castle!
 b2:What is going on?!

p14:
 b1:Just now...
 b2:Was his sword swings?!
 b3:Who is he?!

p15:
 b1:A... Hero!
 b2:What!
 b3:I performed analyze, and it's the result!
 b4:That ability is the Sword Saint's gift...
 b5:He has the Hero class!

p16:
 b1:Lain-sama!

p17:
 b1:She's instantly healing...?!
 b2:Like I said, Lain-sama is basically immortal.

p18:
 b1:Lightning Force!
 b2:Icicle Slash!
 b3:Giant Grave Impact!
 b4:I quite like this dress.
 b5:She's completely unscathed after that onslaught...?!
 b6:No. In reality...
 b7:She is recovering faster than we can even see!

p19:
 b1:Damn
 b2:Monster!
 b3:Why are you attacking a sage?
 b4:Shouldn't a hero be out defeating some demon lord...
 b5:Don't screw with me!
 b6:You guys are nothing but harm to this world!
 b7:Are we sages not the ones that protect this world?
 b8:So we should just forgive your atrocities?!
 b9:How many people do you think died just because some sage felt like it?!
 b10:...Hmm

p20:
 b1:Did someone close to you get killed or manipulated by a sage?
 b2:Either way, I barely come down here so it couldn't have been me.
 b3:You are mistaken.
 b4:Shut up!
 b5:I'll kill every single one of you!
 b6:Do you think I care about your immortality!? Let's see you regenerate after I burn you to nothing!
 b7:Holy Sword
 b8:Kartena!

p21:
 b1:GYAAA
 b2:agh...
 b3:Damn it, the witness!
 b4:Damn, this is completely different from earlier!
 b5:Don't step outside this shield!

p22:
 b1:With all my power...I'll erase you!
 b2:Sword Saint, give me strength...!

p23:
 b1:Wh... what in the world?!
 b2:The lord's castle...!!
 b3:Citizens, get down!
 b4:Protect your heads from the rubble!
 b5:A fire?!
 b6:Explosions?!
 b7:Where's Guard Captain Edelgard?!
 b8:She's supposed to be in the castle right now!!
 b9:Holy shit...Is the captain's still in there?!
 b10:Who in the hell did this...

p24:
 sfx:panting
 b1:I...I did it...
 b2:Even if it cost me the Holy Sword Kartena...
 b3:I defeated...a sage...!
 b4:Ariel...!

p25:
 b1:Is this Ariel your dead lover or something?
 b2:How...
 b3:How did you escape...?!
 b4:I didn't.
 b5:Why would I if I can't be killed anyways?
 b6:Im... Impossible!
 b7:Even the holy sword kartena was burned up in the heat...?!
 b8:I wouldn't be having such a hard time if I could die just by being burnt up.

p26:
 b1:Lain-sama...!
 b2:You're fine?!
 b3:For a moment, I was nothing but I regeneratedimmediatly.
 b4:This degree of immortality might as well be a curse.
 b5:I don't even want to think about how much longer I'll live.
 b6:Pardon me, but how he be dealt with?
 b7:I don't care...
 b8:B.. but attacking a sage is a felony...
 b9:Hmmmm

p27:
 b1:...kill me...
 b2:As a hero, you think your entire purpose is to fight.
 b3:You even lost the sword saint's gift in a grudge against the Sages...
 b4:There's no point in killing you.
 b5:.....
 b6:eh?
 b7:uh... Lain-sama?
 b8:EHHH?!

p28:
txt:UWAAAAA
 b1:Let's all just agree he never came here in the first place?
 b2:uh...
 b3:Understood. No one but us has come here.
 b4:The orders of sages are absolute!!
 text:Captain...
 b5:Edelgard, I came here because your report interested me.
 b6:In the case of those dead theives...
 b7:Let's just say that they died for the sake of an experiment.

p29:
 b1:In the case of those two Japanese who witnessed the incident...
 b2:Takatou Yogiri and Dannoura Tomochika...
 b3:It seems they were there at the time of the death of a dragon sent by Sage Sion.
 b4:They killed a dragon?!
 b5:One of Sion's followers suggested that they used instant death magic...

p30:
 b1:I want you guards to track down those two.
 b2:Yes, ma'am!
 b3:Instant Death Magic
 b4:Does such a thing exist...there's no conctrete proof.
 b5:Immediately contact me when you find their location.
 b6:However, if it does exist...
