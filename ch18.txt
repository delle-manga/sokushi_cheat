p1:
 b1:In the beginning, 'it' was someone who gave blessings.
 b2:'It' appeared out of nowhere, wandering aimlessly around the world.
 b3:'It' answered peoples' prayers according to the number of sacrifices offered.
 b4:It never did anything for itself, nor did it care about the good or bad outcome of the prayers.
 b5:As if it was a machine, it would grant any wish as long as the sacrifices were offered.
 b6:Naturally, people fought over it.
 b7:Even though they were fighting, It continued to fulfill peoples' wishes as they desired.
 b8:It did not take long for humanity to be cut down to half its original size.
 b9:If left alone, humanity would destroy itself...
 
p2:
 b1:People finally realized.
 b2:They realized that 'It' was something beyond humanity's control.
 b3:Something that should be sealed away and untouchable by humanity...
 b4:However, no attack landed on it.
 b5:They all attacked without knowing what 'It' was thinking.
 b6:But, it didn't fight back.
 b7:People couldn't even confine it to any location.
 b8:If that's the case, then we'll pray for it to perish.
 b9:then surely he will die out.
 b10:This wisdom was immediately implemented.
 b11:'It' showed its intentions for the first time.
 b12:That's fine.
 b13:But, the price for that prayer...
 
p3:
 b1:Is all the lives of this world.
 b2:'It' dispersed out maisma all over.
 b3:Creating its underlings to trample down on the rest of the world.
 b4:Humanity was not able to stand up against these underlings and was heading towards extinction.
 b5:But then, the sages appeared.
 
p4:
 b1:And that's why 'It' came to be called 'Devil'...
 b2:heeeh... That battle was really a thousand years ago.
 b3:...Listening to that story makes me feel like it would be a mess if an outsider came and killed it so easily...
 b4:We- well but, didn't it seem like the people in this world were in danger?
 b5:But the miasma is still drifting out of there.
 b6:There may be a time lag before reaching the surroundings due to the influence of the barrier.
 b7:Then, no one will probably notice if we stay silent about it, right?
 b8:I think so.
 b9:Either way, we can't change what's been done.
 b10:Okay.
 b11:Let's quickly get to the bottom of the tower so we can talk to the Sword Saint then head to the capital.
 b12:We got this!
 b13:It's a secret!!
 
p5:
 b1:Star crystals are...?
 
p6:
 b1:Hey!
 b2:Wait, Rainier!
 b3:F-Fredrica-san!
 b4:You have those custom stones, right?!
 b5:Give it to me!
 b6:What are you going to do?
 b7:Restore my magic power!
 b8:I think I've explained it before but...
 b9:The stone is tied to me and isn't effective for other people...
 b10:haa?!
 b11:Then what did you follow me here for!
 b12:You're completely useless! Forget it!
 
p7:
 b1:...would've went alone.
 b2:well, it seems she doesn't want to go along with us...
 b3:Which one are we going to go down?
 b4:We're the last ones still up here...
 text:sorry
 b5:We don't really care, how about you Rick-san?
 b6:There wasn't really a rule on when you arrive or leave, so it's fine.
 b7:Collecting points in the tower and protecting you guys at the same time seems to be the least dangerous idea.
 b8:If you say so...
 b9:And it's as I expected.
 b10:Take a look at the tower's routes.
 b11:Waa!
 
p8:
 b1:What the! It's full of traps!
 b2:It should be easy to navigate thanks to those who went first.
 b3:They seem to have already eliminated most the monsters, traps, and other stuff.
 b4:Looks like most the traps only go off once.
 text:A cut wire...
 b5:No one would get caught in a trap that they watched someone else get caught in.
 b6:It would be really unlucky to set off a trap they somehow missed...
 b7:Press
 
p9:
 b1:rainier-san!!
 b2:Sorry, I'm really unlucky...
 b3:That's definitely a fatal wound!!
 b4:fuuu...
 b5:I'd be dead if not for the apology stone...!
 sfx:shine
 text:wow
 b6:you even have the same clothes as before.
 
p10:
 b1:These star crystals... what kind items are they?
 b2:This is the first time I've seen them.
 b3:Yeah, you're correct! It seems like I'm the only one who has them...
 b4:They can be used for three things: one use is a complete recovery.
 b5:Another use is like a power boost.
 b6:And the third use...
 b7:I can use three to do a gacha roll or 30 for a 10x gacha roll.
 b8:gacha...
 text:what's that?
 b9:Just watch.
 b10:C'mon!
 b11:ooh!
 b12:I got... a brush?!
 
p11:
 b1:...And so, I'm able to get a random item like this!
 text:wow! *clap clap*
 b2:Is it special?!
 b3:[N] (normal) Brush! It's just a very ordinary brush!
 b4:A miss?!
 b5:Also, I can't use a stone unless it's in my hand.
 b6:Could I trouble you to place a stone from my bag into my hand when I'm about to die?
 b7:Huh? You only have three left?
 b8:At midnight, I get a new apology stone for each bad luck event from the previous day.
 b9:At the current rate of you dying, will three last you until midnight?!
 b10:That's worrying... Also, why don't you just always hold one in your hand?
 b11:Ah! Good Idea! I never thought of that!
 b12:Tying it to my hand would be perfect!
 text:You have anything to tie it with?
 
p12:
 b1:huh?
 b2:what are you doing takatou-kun?
 b3:well
 b4:There's a chest behind the trap that hit Rainier-san...
 b5:what's this?
 b6:It says "1 point".
 b7:Huh? It just disappeared.
 b8:Does that mean that you get 1 point now?
 b9:It's like a game.
 b10:If that's the case, the people who went ahead have the advantage.
 b11:hmm.. this way's is a dead end.
 b12:Looks like the chest is empty too.
 b13:Ah... This floor is gray.
 b14:Doesn't that mean this is the battle area?
 b15:hm?
 b16:What's next to the door?
 b17:"Only one person can exit"
 b18:...Is what it says.

 p13:
  b1:I can feel magic coming from the door.
  b2:This must be one of the trials.
  b3:If only one person can exit, then only one person should enter!
  b4:Would it really be that easy...?!
  b5:Well, I'll go in first!
  b6:And either way, I have the apology stone!
  b7:eh?! Wait a minute rainier-san...
  b8:Please leave it to me!
  sfx:slam
  b9:waa?!
  b10:I guess it really is a special room.
  b11:GYAAAAAAAAAAAA
  b12:uwaa?!
  b13:...He really got himself into something so quickly?!
  b14:Let's go in.
  
 p14:
  b1:Rainier-san! Are you alright?!
  b2:*ara* oh my
  b3:We meet again Rick-san.
  b4:ah...!
  b5:Teresa-dono!
  b6:This is your work?!
  
 p15:
  b1:You did all this...?
  b2:Indeed
  b3:But I don't think I can be blamed.
  b4:After all, this room has a mechanism where the doors won't open if there is more than one inside...
  b5:In other words, we're meannt to kill eachother.
  b6:But until just now, you must've been in alone in this room.
  b7:Meaning that you were probably waiting here...?
  b8:Doing that...
  b9:Well
  b10:Apparently, it's a gimmick that only occurs once.
  b11:The exit door can be opened freely now...
  b12:The exit being...
  b13:This door right behind me.
  
 p16:
  b1:Fufufuu What will you do now? Return to the entrance?
  b2:Don't go back! Look closely!
  b3:There are thin wires hanging all over the place!
  b4:*ara* oh my, You have such good eyes.
  b5:It's a real shame you didn't get caught in my trap.
  b6:Yeah, she's a swordsman of the roaring sword class...
  b7:She's the only one among them who uses a thin thread-like sword...!
  b8:Since when is "swordsman" such a broad term?!
  b9:Tch! I'll stall her here.
  b10:Try to find a gap and head for the exit!
  b11:Fufufuu
  b12:Sword Saint-sama would be troubled if the cannon fodder survived.
  
 p17:
  b1:After all!
  b2:Wouldn't you say...
  b3:A knight of the holy king...
  b4:has to be one of the strongest of them all!!
  
 p18:
  b1:So strong!!
  b2:Even though Rick-san is very strong... Who is this Teresa person...
  b3:She's just playing around!
  b4:Tch... If strength was the only qualification, you'd never have been disqualified!
  b5:You wouldn't understand such a thing!!
  b6:It's takes everything Rick has just to block her when she's simply having fun...!
  b7:A single distraction would be lethal...!
  
 p19:
  b1:Die.
  
 p20:
 b1:...eh?
 b2:Uhm
 b3:Isn't this Rainier's hand and stone over here?
 b4:Uwaaaaah
 b5:Rainier-san!!
 b6:I'm... sorry for my poor teamwork...
 b7:Please place the stone in my remaining hand...urgh
 b8:He's almost dead already!!
