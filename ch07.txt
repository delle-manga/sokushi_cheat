p1:
 title: Magnificent as always, Master!
 volume:Volume 1 consisting of chapters 1-5 is on sale!

p2:
 b1:Do you know how to get back to your world?
 b2:We were actually forcefully summoned to this world...
 b3:I would like to negotiate.
 b4:eh?
 b5:I will provide what information I possess, and in return...
 b6:I will not be attacked by you.
 b7:How about that?

p3:
 b1:This robot...is that wary of Takatou-kun's ability after fighting the sage...?
 b2:Then, can you tell us how to return to our original world?
 b3:I apologize, but I can only return to my own world.
 b4:In that case, could you bring us with you...
 b5:That too is impossible.
 b6:There are 2 reasons.
 b7:First
 b8:I do not have my entire existance present here.
 b9:I am in a state where part of me remains in my original world to which I am connected.
 b10:So, I could return to my world, but you would not.

p4:
 b1:I see.
 b2:So it's like you are diving into this world while attached to a lifeline.
 b3:That analogy is appropriate.
 b4:This world is located at the bottom of the energy potential.
 b5:It is easy to descend but
 b6:requires huge amounts of energy to ascend.
 b7:In my case, my connection with my original world provides the energy to return.
 b8:The reason Kanakawa and others were able to return once was because there was a connection to our world...

p5:
 b1:The returning world's coordinates
 b2:and returning energy.
 b3:These two things are necessary to make return possible.
 b4:Any other problems are trivial compared to those two.
 b5:I see... Well
 b6:Finding me these things and giving me this advice.
 b7:That will be the terms of our negotiation.
 b8:Only that?
 b9:Up until now, I didn't know how we would return.
 b10:Plus, I don't really have anything else I want.
 b11:Dannoura-san, do you have anything to ask for?
 b12:eh, no... I can't think of anything on the spot.

p6:
 b1:[Fufufu] Then turn to me!
 b2:I have suggestions!
 b3:Mokomoko-san?!
 b4:W... well, it's fine but...
 b5:Anyways.
 b6:The second reason you can't bring us to your world?
 b7:I can't bring a dangerous existance such as yourself back to my world.
 b8:Protecting my world takes priority over my own life.
 b9:Is that so?

p7:
 b1:-Several Hours Later-
 b2:Ah! hey, hey. I can see Hanabusa! It looks just like a Japanese city!
 b3:The atmosphere is quite different from that of Kuenza city.
T/L:Kuenza was the first city
 b4:No walls too...
 b5:That pole might be the border?
 b6:Everything inside is probably protected by the power of a sage.
 b7:...Hey! Takatou-kun, come one!

p8:
 b1:...We should have asked the robot to carry us.
 b2:It would be troublesome if it was seen near this place...
 b3:It at least seems to be an enemy to the people of this world.
 b4:Maybe you should do some exercise and train your body?
 b5:I was forced to exercise so I'm somewhat agile...
 b6:But yeah, I'll admit my lack of stamina.
 b7:We ought to have had the robot give us a vehicle at least.
 b8:Was there a reason we had to leave that abruptly?

p9:
 b1:Too much shadow.
 b2:I've told you about being able to sense stuff like killing intent and life hazards, right?
 b3:Like Morihei Ueshiba? That famous Aikido master who was able to dodge bullets by seeing their trajectories like light rays.
 b4:Might be similar, yeah.
 b5:In my case it's less like light rays and more like black lines, kind of like shadows.
 b6:It was like the black shadow around the train was growing quickly, so the danger level was increasing.
 b7:About a 30% risk level.
 b8:So it's kind of like the rain predictions?
 b9:Something like that.
 b10:This place feels like under 1% change of danger so compared to earlier it's pretty safe.

p10:
 b1:Looks like this one doesn't have a wall.
 b2:I wonder if that means they don't have to worry about enemies.
 b3:Not so sure about that.
 b4:Basically, it seems this world is full of dangers outside of the protection of the sages.
 b6:eh? But
 b7:You say that but we didn't meet any on our way here, did we?
 b8:Well that's because I was killing everything.
 b9:...huh?
 b10:A bunch of monsters and thugs.
 b11:They were targeting us.
 b12:Tell me those things!
 b13:Just thought it wasn't worth mentioning.

p11:
 b1:In that case, let's hurry up and get inside the city!
 b2:Weren't we going to wait here for everyone in the class?
 b3:Here, come on!
 b4:Hanabusa City

p12:
 b1:Waaa, a skyscraper hotel!
 b2:The concierge recommended this hotel before we left.
 b3:Let's stay here for a while until we can join up with the class.
 b4:Sounds good!
 b5:Just as I thought!
 b6:If it isn't Dannoura-san!
 b7:eh?

p13:
 b1:Tachibana-kun?!
 b2:Why're you here?
 b3:So you were safe, that's nice.
 b4:Everyone in the class is still in the primeval forest, right?
 b5:Did he take the train before us?
 b6:I split up from the rest of the class.
 b7:No point in going along with an inefficient leveling method, you know?
 b8:Is that so?

p14:
 b1:Who is this woman?
 b2:Acting so familiar with Yuuki!
 b3:huh?
 b4:Leave it, Erika.
 b5:They're my classmates.
 b6:If Yuuki says so...
 b7:Magnificent as ever, Master!
 b8:What a tolerant heart even towards such uncultured people!
 b9:Truly a personality fit for a monarch!
 b10:Takatou-kun... 
 b11:what's going on here?
 text:You're asking me...
 b12:Oh!
 b13:I still haven't introduced myself.

p15: each girl has different font
 b1:These women are my guards chosen among my many slaves.
 b2:Introduce yourselves.
 b3:I'm feel no need, so only because Yuuki says to!
 b4():Fifth rank of the guards, I'm Erika.
 b5:I wouldn't speak if not for master's command.
 b6:Fourth rank among the guards, they call me Stephanie.
 b7:Third rank Chelsea...
 b8:Onee-chan is dead?
 b9:I am Euphemia, second rank.
 b10:Could you please disappear from my view?
 b11:I am the Guard Leader, Riza.
 b12:Don't be concieted just because your his classmate please.
R>L:E-ri-ka, Su-Te-Fua-Ni, Chie-Ru-Shi, E-U-Fue-Mi-A, Ri-Za

p16:
 b1:Could you guys stop expressing such hostility?!
 b2:What did I even do?
 b3:Oh, sorry. I'm not good at being strict with the girls.
 b4:Be quiet for a little bit, girls.
 b5:Tachibana is one of the classmates who left us in the bus.
 b6:I don't know what power he got, but he sure is confident.
 b7:Ah, no... He was like this originally...
 b8:His narcissism and overconfidence always made him pretty popular with girls.
 b9:Seriously?
 b10:...High school might've been more interesting than I thought.
 b11:Maybe I shouldn't have spent all my time at school asleep.

p17:
 b1:Meeting you here must be some kind of click of fate.
 b2:Dannoura-san, will you become my lover?
 b3:Huh?

p18:
 sfx1:wings flapping
 sfx2:tapping
 b1:A report?

p19:
 b1:L...Lain-sama! This is Edelgard.
 b2:Following the trail of Takatou Yogiri and Dannoura Tomochika, we came up on a scene on the Hanabusa train tracks.
 b3:S...Sage Santarou-sama... was found dead there.
 b4:The cause of death is unknown...
 b5:A report from Kuenza's guard's captain.
 b6:This is the matter for which I invited you.
 b7:Sage Sion.
 sfx:Fuu

p20:
 b1:I heard the story about the instant death magic from your acolyte Youichi.
 b2:Do you mean the sage candidates I summoned?
 b3:Santarou-san headed out to intercept some big robot, wasn't that what killed him?
 b4:Possibly, but there's no proof.
 b5:Either way, I doubt it's fine to leave them be.
 b6:I'll deal with those two.
 b7:I've seen both of them close up...neither struck me as very rich in potential.
 b8:And for what reason would they kill Santarou-san?
 b9:There wasn't any damage to his corpse, right?
 b10:Right, there's no evidence the philosopher's stone was extracted from him.
 b11:That point is mysterious...
 b12:I was thinking I'd discuss the matter with you beforehand, since you summoned them.

p21:
 b1:Is that all?
 b2:I thought Lain-sama wished to discuss the matter of Kurayami.
 b3:Kuriyama was Santarou's issue, I believe.
 b4:He drove it away, but it still remains in this world.
 b5:The question of who'll be responsible for repelling it next...
 b6:Correct!
 b7:If you deal with it, you can do as you please with those two people.
 b8:...Hmm
 b9:Fine, I'll handle it.
 b10:Mayasuki.

p22:
 b1:You called? Lain.
 sfx:shimmer
 b2:Gather the Undead Battalion and head to Hanabusa.
 b3:You should find two Japanese called Takatou Yogiri and Dannoura Tomochika there, deal with them.
 b4:What?
 b5:Head out for just two people?
 b6:It's just two, but there's a need to get rid of them.
 b7:They've got something like instant death magic.
 b8:There's a decent chance a regular troop wouldn't stand a chance.
 b9:Recruit new soldiers on-site if you don't have enough.
 b10:Oioioi! Hey, aight, hey now.
 b11:You saying I can wreck Hayabusa, that's what you mean, right?
 b12:Don't cha worry! I'll handle it, you go ahead and expect some nice results!
 sfx:evil smile
