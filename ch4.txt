p1:
 b1:Half Die.
 b2:Gu...?!
 b3:GUUAAAAAAA?!

p2:
 b1:I guess...
 b2:the 'lower body' might have been too much.
 b3:Well then, 'Right Ankle'.
 b4:Ah, failure.
 b5:How about, 'Left Arm'.
 b6:Gyaaaa?!
 b7:Ugoooo?!
 b8:T- Takatou-kun?! This is...
 b9:Well...
 b10:I was thinking I might be able to go easy on them.
 b11:It's my first time trying to kill individual parts.
 b12:Doesn't seem to be working fully despite using extra energy.
 b13:Eyes.

p3:
 b1:Guoooo!!
 b2:GYAAAAA!!
 b3:Nose.
 b4:Ears.
 b5:Wh- What!?
 b6:What in the world are you!
 b7:well,
 b8:Explaining it would be bothersome.

p4:
 b1:No way! You're supposed to be powerless!
 b2:He...
 b3:Help me!
 b4:I- I was forced to work for this Japanese!
 b5:Mireille!
 b6:My mother is ill and I had to make money somehow!
 b7:Really?
 b8:Y- yes!
 b9:My father abandoned my sick mother... and I have hungry, little brothers at home!
 b10:So, please...!
 b11:And you thought,
 b12:That'd justify mugging people and selling them off?

p5:
 b1:Partially killing isn't really efficient.
 b2:I don't like to purposely torment people...
 b3:No real use for them...
 b4:Please! Please spare me!
 b5:This is the only way to survive in this world!
 b6:W-we're both Japanese, aren't we?!
 b7:Don't lump me together with you.
 b8:Die.

p6:
 b1:Huh?!
 b2:A misfire...?!
 b3:Quick, now!
 b4:Mireille!
 b5:Fuck, Wait for me!
 b6:Takatou-kun?!
 b7:Is it fine to let them escape?!

p7:
 b1:I'm not letting them get away, though?
 b2:...eh?
 b3:Hey! I'm not letting them get away, though?
 b4:Hey! Mireille!
 b5:I can't climb up there!
 b6:Not far enough...
 b7:from that monster...!

p8:
 b1:This should be far enough...
 b2:As expected, he can't chase me up here...
 b3:What... On earth...
 b4:Is he...?!
 b5:As I explained earlier, my power is irreversible.
 b6:The target always dies.
 b7:s- sure.

p9:
 b1:huh?
 b2:I'm...losing...energy...
 b3:But, how long it takes the target to die has some leeway.
 b4:It can't really be called going easy on someone though...
 b5:Which means...
 b6:yeah,
 b7:no way...?
 b8:My breathing...
 b9:and heart...
 b10:have stopped...
 b11:They should be dying somewhere right about now.
 b12:a...
 txt:Approaching them was a mistake......

p10:
 b1:Halt! We are guards!
 b2:I have some questions regarding this situation.
 b3:What happened to all the fallen ones in this alley?
 b4:Oh, well...
 b5:we got lost in the alley and found it like this...

p11:
 b1:That's a lie!
 b2:I watched as the thieves surrounding you suddenly fell down!
 b3:If you guards were watching, why didn't you help?!
 b4:We are currently investigating this criminal syndicate...
 b5:in order to find the connected nobles.
 b6:In other words, you were going to let them kidnap us and follow them?
 b7:That's right!
 b8:Bastard. This world really does lack decent people...
 b9:Disclosing investigation results...more so an idiot than bad person.

p12:
 b1:Don't get any strange ideas, Japanese.
 b2:We guards are blessed by the saints so that your "gifts" from the sages don't affect us.
 b3:Is that so.
 b4:Captain Edelgard,
 b5:According to my analyze skill, these two don't possess any gifts.
 b6:What?!
 b7:In that case...
 b8:It's hard to imagine these two are responsible.
 b9:Wait!
 b10:Then why did you lie! Suspicious!
 b11:I apologize but...
 b12:we don't know what happened.
 b13:Suddenly, the thieves began falling down all around us.
 b14:I know it's hard to believe me...
 b15:hmm...

p13:
 b1:Damn! Fine!
 b2:I'll investigate the bodies George.
 b3:Haa...
 b4:I'm sorry for my captain's rudeness...
 b5:No problem, now that the misunderstanding has been cleared up.
 b6:However, we still need you to fill out a report.
 b7:Could you come along to headquarters?
 b8:sure...
 b9:Hey! George!
 b10:One's still alive! A dogman!
 b11:Ah, the guy from earlier.
 b12:I killed just the eyes, nose, and ears.
 b13:I might as well leave the only one I was able to successfuly go easy on.

p14:
 b1:Amazing! It's like a castle!
 b2:So this is what luxury hotels are like!
 b3:The guard earlier said we'd be safest at this hotel.
 b4:Well then, we'll meet in the lobby tomorrow morning.
 b5:Yeah.
 b6:I'm in the next room so call me if something happens.

p15:
 b1:Waaaa!
 b2:It's huge! All this for one person?!
 b3:The inside of the hotel really is Japanese friendly.
 b4:The school trip ended up like this, but...
 b5:If not for Takatou-kun, who knows what would've happened to me...
 b6:I wonder if he's actually interested in me...
 b7:Or just my boobs...

p16:
 b1:Who?!

p17:
 b1:A familiar looking almost spherical silhouette...
 b2:What! Onee-chan?!
 b3:How did you get to another world?! 
 b4:Would you please not compare me to such a person!
 b5:You may call me Mokomoko Dannoura!
 b6[]:Wife of the son of the founder of the Dannoura-Style, called the rejuvenator of the Dannoura dynasty and the guardian deity of House Dannoura; your ancestor, your ever-watchful spirit and your guardian angel!
 b7:Don't cram everything into one sentence!
 b9:I am your ancestral guardian!

p18:
 b1:Guardian spirit? Are you really not my older sister?
 b2:We have the same bloodline so we may look alike.
 b3:I have emerged since you are in a serious emergency.
 b4:I have some questions.
 b5:Ask anything!
 b6:Where have you been?!
 b7:Haven't there been several situations you could have helped out?!
 b8:I was waiting for you to be alone!
 b9:That youngster with you is really scary!
 b10:If I showed up out of nowhere, I might have been erased on the spot!
 b11:Eh... You mean Takatou-kun?

p19:
 b1:As a high ranking divine spirit,
 b2:I can instinctively tell when things are trouble.
 b3:Do you mean that Takatou-kun's ability would even affect you...
 b4:Alright, I'll tell Takatou-kun about you and you should be fine.
 b5:I'm counting on you.
 b6:So next, what was that about coming to my help?
 b7:I can't assist you in a physical manner as I'm a purely spiritual entity.
 b8:So, my helping will be mostly limited to spiritual protection.
 b9:In fact, I'm the one who blocked that gift and system stuff from installing...
 b10:Whaa?!

p20:
 b1:That was you!
 b2:What are you doing messing with things?!
 b3:Oh? Did you actually want something that obscure?
 b4:uuu...
 b5:It's designed for battle.
 b6:Just by having it installed makes one more militant and decreases their fear of death.
 b7:On the other hand, it numbs one's aversion to manslaughter.
 b8:You're basically turned into a battle junkie.
 b9:Battle is inevitable to survive in this world, and as such...
 b10:It would be advantageous to be able to fight without remorse.
 b11:Advantageous?
 b12:Also, What are classes and skills?

p21:
 b1:This is my guess.
 b2:The sage who gave the abilities knew what they would be.
 b3:Your abiltiy would have only been negative...
 b4: so I would not trust these abilities.

p22:
 b1:They are the kind of things that gnaw away at the soul.
 b2:Once accepting this, the sages take control over life and death.

p23:
 b1:It worked like that...
 b2:Does that mean the others who failed installation also had a guardian?
 b3:No clue about the rest.
 b4:I'm the only guardian spirit that came along to this world.
 b5:S- sure.
 b6:Anyways! It is my wish to return the successor of the Dannoura-Style Archery to the original world safely!
b7:Yeah, I'd like to go back to Yamayama as well, but...
 b8:Right now, I'm reliant on Takatou-kun...
 b9:in this world where dragons and skills exist.

p24:
 b1:Hmm...
 b2:The Dannoura-Style of archery.
 b3:A style of the Heian era that combined the use of weapons and hand-to-hand combat, taught on in House Dannoura ever since, until the present day. 
 NOTE:Heian era = 800-1200AD
 b4:However, it would still be dangerous if you were proficient in the Dannoura-Style.
 b5:As such! I shall teach you: the True Dannoura-Style!
 b6:I shall name it the "My Guardian Spirit Is the Strongest, So Even the Other World Is a Cakewalk!" strategy!
 b7:Are you really from the Heian era?!

p25:
 b1:Following Morning
 b2:Morning, Takatou-kun...
 b3:Morning. Couldn't sleep?
 b4:Well, there were some distractions.
 b5:So, are we going to chase after the class today?
 b6:Right, but after parting last night, I talked with the concierge there.
 b7:She looked into our classmates' whereabouts, told me several ways to get there ourselves, 
 b8:prepared us an item that'll allow us to bypass the language barrier, and
 b9:even came up with a way to charge my console.
 b10:That concierge is so capable there's nothing left for us to do!
