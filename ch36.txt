あ
すみません
Ah, excuse me.

後から合流して二人増えたんですけど...
We arrived later than everyone else...

全員泊まれます?
...so is there room for two more?


==p2==


もちろん
大丈夫ですすぐにご用意いたしましょう
Of course it's fine. We'll prepare some rooms right away.

ありがとうございます
Thank you very much.

壇ノ浦さん
高遠くん...
Dannoura-san, Takatou-kun...

何ょ?
矢崎くん
What do you want, Yazaki-kun?

私たちも時問差で遅れてギフトが出現したんだよ
We also got our gifts after a delay by the way.

私たちが来たらなんか文句あるわけ?
There should be no complaints with us coming as well, right?

そ...
それは...
That's...

君たちを置いていった判断に間連いはなかったと思ってる
We didn't consider that there could have been a delay when we left you guys behind.

今から思えば他にゃりょうはあったかもしれないが
Seeing the situation in hindsight, there were other options...

あの時できることには限界があったから
but in the moment, there was a time limit and we were stressed out...

俺はどうでもいいよ
Well, I don't really care.

そもそも寝てたしね
I was asleep the whole time anyways.


==p3==


私は正直に言えばむかついてはいるけど
To be honest, I was pissed off about it.

今さらぐちぐち言うのもうっとうしいからもうそれはいいよ
And hearing you mumbling about it now is starting to piss me off again, so let's just drop it.

私は准お二人の合流は歓迎すべきことだと思いますよ
Personally, I think the reunion with the two of you is a welcome one.

こんなわけのわからない異世界において数少ない仲間なんですから
They are some of the few people in this strange new world that we can call friends...

協カし合わないでどうするというんですか
So it only makes sense to cooperate with each other, doesn't it?

し...しかし
彼らが信用できるかどうか..．
B-but, whether or not to trust them is...!


==p4==


それはあなたが同じ目にあったなら...
Aren't you just imposing your own thought process onto the situation...

復曹に走る感性の持ち主だからそのように思ってしまうのではないかしら?
Since if it were you in that situation, the only thing you would think about is revenge?

ぐ．．．
Uh, well...

たしか矢崎がリーダー格じゃなかった?
I thought you said Yazaki was the leader?

私もバスではそう思ってたんだけど...
That's how it seemed on the bus, but now...

てかあの女子誰?
Also, who is that girl?

え？！
eh?!

秋野さんまで知らないわけ？！
現役アイドルだよ？！
You don't even know Akino-san?!
Even though she's an active idol?!

秋野蒼空です
My name is Akino Sora.

不肖ながら今は私がみなさんそ率いきせていただいてます
Though I might not be the best, I am leading everyone right now.

よろしくお願いいたしますね
I look forward to working together with you.

聞いえちゃった
She heard us...


==p5== TITLE

二人の能カと目的は．．．？!
The goals and abilities of these two are...?!

本当に申し訳ありませんでした！！
We are really sorry!!

ほら!
キャロルも謝ってください！！
Hey! Please apologize too Carol!!

WHY?!
(in english)

ナゼワ夕シガ？！
Why me!?

片言ゃめてください！！
Please speak normally!!

えっと．．．？
今これどういう状況？
uhm...? What kind of situation is this?

二宮諒子韋んと留学生のキャロル・S・レーンさんに呼び出されて謝られてる．．．
Ninomiya Ryouko-san and the international student, Carol S. Lain-san, asked me to call you here so they can apologize...

そもそも なぜ 謝られてるのかがわかんないんだけど...
Why in the first place they even want to apologize, I don't know...


==p7==


それは高遠くんたちをバスに置いていった件にっいてです！
This is in regards to leaving Takatou-kun and the others on the bus back then!!

突然のことで統率スキルに抵抗することもでぎず...
We were confused and couldn't resist the effects of the others' leadership gifts...

普段クールぶってる諒子が慌ててるのは面白いねー
It's quite amusing to see the usually calm Ryouko in such a panicked state...

高遠くんは置いてかれたのはどうでもいいって言ってたじゃない
After all, Takatou-kun himself said it doesn't bother him that he was left behind.

なぜ謝る必要が?
So why should we apologize?

第一門が開いてるんですょ!
The first seal is open!

つまりそれはいつどこでだって
In other words, no matter where or when...

高遠くんはクラス全員でも即死させれるってことなんです!
Takatou-kun could kill the entire class instantly!

謝るほかに何ができるっていうんですか！!
What else can we do but apologize!!


==p8==


もしかして二宮さんは俺のことを知ってるの?
Does that mean that Ninomiya-san knows about me?

諒子は「研究所」から
Ryouko is from the "Laboratory"...

私は「機関」から派遣されてこのクラスに来てるの
While I was dispatched from the "Agency" to this class...

高遠くんの動向を監視するためにね
...in order to monitor the movements of Takatou-kun.

あー...まあ
野放しにされるわけがないとは思ってたけど...
Ah well, I doubted I would be left unmonitored...

まさか二人も監視者がクラスにいるとはね...
But, to think that there were two people in my class alone...

あとは深井くんが「教団」から
Additionally, Fukai-kun is from the "Cult".

私の知る限りではこの3人かな
As far as I know, we are the only three.

深井．．．?
誰だっけ...
Fukai...? Who's that...

普段全くクラスメイトに興味なかったからなあ...
I never really paid attention to my classmates...


==p9==


えっと...?
レーンさんなんの話?
uhm...? What is Lain-san talking about?

なんだったら私は席そ外すけど...
If you want, I can leave...

キャロルでしいよ!
知千佳も高遠くんも!
Just Carol is fine, for both Tomochika and Takatou-kun!

待って！
一緒にいて壇ノ浦さんッ！
Wait!! Please stay here, Dannoura-san!!

えっ なんで?
huh? why?

謝りたいってことならわかったよ
I understand if you want to apologize.

俺は気にしてないし赦しの言葉がいるのなら赦すよ
But I really don't care, so if you want my forgiveness, you have it.

けどなんで壇ノ浦きんも一緒に呼んだの?
But why did you ask Dannoura-san to be here as well?

そ...それは...
T-that's

壇ノ浦さんが 一緒なら 穏便に話を 聞いてもらえるかと...
I just thought that if Dannoura-san was with us, you might be more willing to hear us out...

へ？
huh?

なんで私．．．？
Why me...?


==p10==


だって高校生の男女がここまで一緒に旅してきたんでしょう？！
Because you're a girl who's traveled together with a highschool boy for so long?!

それはっまりそういう関係ってことではないのですか？！
Doesn't that mean you're in some kind of relationship?!

な？！
Wha?!

そういうのじゃないからね？！
勘違いしないでょね!
It's not like that, okay?! You must be misunderstanding!

えー？
ehhh?

高遠くんこんな可愛い女子高生とずっと一緒にいて自制できてるの?
Takatou-kun, have you been able to control yourself with such a cute highschool girl this whole time?

ん?　ああ
自制っていうか適度にー
Hm? Well, within moderation I would say...

やめろー!
生々しい話は！
Stop! Don't talk about it so openly!!

諒子ったら知千佳が生きてたのはそれが理由と思い込んでたみたいなの!
It seems Ryouko assumed that was the only reason Tomochika was still alive!

そ...
それだけだとは思ってないですけどね!
W-well, not the only reason!


==p11==


じゃあそれはおいといて
Well, now that that's settled.

今の状況がどうなってるか教えてくれないかな
Can you tell us what's going on with the class right now?

こっちの事情を知ってるんなら話も楽だし
It would be much easier to talk with everyone if we understood the situation.

そうそうエロゲ男爵って何なの？！
Yeah, what is this Eroge Baron people have been talking about?!

食いつくのそこ？
That's what you're most interested in?

私たちが得た能力は確かに便利なんだけど
The abilities we gained are certainly useful, but...

もともとの本人の素質とか性格とかが反映してるみたいなの
It seems people received abilities that reflected their original qualities and personality.

たとえば私のクラスはサムライでキャロルはニンジャ
For example, my class is Samurai and Carol's is Ninja.

どちらも戦闘系のクラスです
Both of which are combat classes.

ただ人によっては戦いの役には立たないスキルの場合もあって
However, some people received abilities that aren't really useful in battle.

戦闘力の強さでグループ分けして行動することになったのね
So we decided to split into groups according to strength in terms of fighting ability.

で 女子の猛反対でグループは全て男女混合にしない方針になったんだけど...
And with fierce opposition from the girls, the policy was altered so no groups had a mix of boys and girls...

猛反対ってなんで?
Why was the opposition fierce?


==p12==


その元凶が
エロゲ男爵・牛尾真也
エロゲ侯爵・棟方圭一
エロゲ伯爵・矢立光雄の
エロゲ三貴族の能力なのよ
Because of the abilities of the Three Eroge Aristocrats, the Eroge Count Yatate Mitsuo, the Eroge Marquis Munakata Keiichi, and the Eroge Baron Ushio Shinya.

エロゲ三貴族?!
The Three Eroge Aristocrats?!

何そのクラス名！！
What kind of class name is that?!

いえ正式名は
エロゲマスター
エロゲマイスター
エロゲマニアで
はあだ名です
No, the noble titles were just a nickname given to them. The official names were Eroge Master, Eroge Meister, and Eroge Mania.

あだ名も正式名も相当ひどいな！
Both the nicknames and the official names are terrible!!

じゃあさっき王様に向かって牛尾くんが使った能力って...
Then the ability that Ushio-kun tried to use against the king...

彼の能力は触れた物の時を止める時間停止
His ability is that he can stop time for anything that he touches.

刃を手づかみで逸らそうとしたんでしょうね
He probably intended to deflect the blade by touching it with his hand.

うわ．．．
uwaa...

あとは棟方くんが透明化
Munakata-kun's ability is invisibility.

矢立くんは触手です
And, Tatate's is tentacles.

触手って能カなの?!
His ability is tentacles?!

好きなところに生やせるらしいよ?
I heard he's able to grow a tentacle wherever he wants or something like that?


==p13==


だけど賢者のランダムに付与された能力じゃなくて本人の指向によるものだし
And that's how we came to the conclusion that abilities weren't just randomly assigned by the sage, but rather it reflected the person.

女子としてはいつ悪用されるかわかったもんじゃないじゃない?
And as girls, we never knew when it might be misused against us, you know?

あー...たしかに生理的嫌悪感に近いよね...
Yeah... being near them instinctively felt disgusting...

しかも棟方くんは透明化に加えて透視能力も使えるんですが
Moreover, Munakata-kun has the ability to see through things in addition to his invisibility...

それそ隠して過少申告していたんです
And he intended to hide that fact and not tell anyone.

ただ　棟方くんの嘘は鳳くんが暴いてしまいましたが...
But thankfully, Ootori-kun exposed Munakata-kun's secret.

鳳くんのクラスはコンサルタントで
Ootori-kun's class is Consultant...

情報分析系のスキルがあって他者の能力を解析できるの
...which has an analysis skill that can see more information on the abilities of people.

え．．．
eh...

ギフトの能力を見破れるスキルの持ち主もいるの?
So some people might have skills that can see through the gift abilities?

それは...まずいかも...
That... might be bad...

まずいね...
That would be bad...


==p14==


あ　やっぱりギフトに目覚めたっての嘘だった?
After all, we lied about getting gifts after a delay, didn't we?

まあね
Well

一応アイテムで偽装はしてるんだけどこれってばれる?
We've been disguising it with an item so far, but will they be able to tell?

ああ
最初のホテルでコンシエルジュさんに頼んだやつね
Oh yeah, the ones we got from Concierge-san back at the first hotel.

その偽装のランクが5以上なら確実に大丈夫でしょう
If the disguise is Rank 5 or higher, then you should be fine.

クラスメイトの中でもランク4が最高位ですから
Rank 4 is the highest anyone in the class has gotten so far.

ランク?
Rank?

システムが判定することには全てランクが関わってるの
Ranks are involved in the decision making by the system.

ランク１の偽装ならランク２の鑑定で見破られちゃう逆なら無理ね
If it's a Rank 1 disguise, it will be seen through by a Rank 2 appraisal, but not the other way around.

ランクの差は絶対で同ランクの場合は判定が複雑だから一概には言えないけど...
When there's a difference in rank, it's pretty clear, but if the ranks are the same then the judgement is complicated so I can't say which way will be favored...


==p15==


その指輪のランクは6だな
That ring is Rank 6.

もこもこさん!
Mokomoko-san!

うンク...わかるの?
You can tell the rank?

うむ
我も引き続きこの世界の情報の瀞析は進めておるからな
Yup, I'm continuing to analyze the information systems of this world.

今誰と言てたの?
Who were you talking to just now?

壇ノ浦さんの背後霊
Dannoura-san's guardian spirit.

オー!
それはすごいね!
どこどこ？！
Oh! That's amazing! Where is it?! Where?!

あ
普通に信じるんだ
Ah, you believed it so casually.

そりゃねー
異世界があって魔法があって高遠くんみたいなのがいて
Of course. After all, there's other worlds, there's magic, and there's even someone like Takatou-kun.

幽霊だけ信じないのも変じゃない?
Wouldn't it be strange to not also believe in spirits?


==p16==


だよねー
背後霊なんてレア度低いよね
Oh, then guardian spirits might not be that rare?

普通って感じだよね
It might be pretty normal.

なぜわざわざ我を見ながら言うのだ
Why did you explicitly look at me when you said that?

ともかくランク6ならまず普通にはばれないでしょう
Anyways, as long as it's Rank 6, you probably won't be exposed.

ランクは最大１０までですが4以上で人外7以上は神話級となっているのです
The ranks have a maximum of 10, ranks 7 and above are considered legendary, and ranks 4 and above are considered beyond natural humans.

これそんなすごいアイテムだったの?
Doesn't that mean these items we got are amazing?

でも
クラス内でもランク差はバラバラで．．．
But even across classes, the difference in a rank is quite drastic...

初期能カに差がありすぎて大半の者は有利な者の言いなりになるしかない
There's so much difference between initial skills that most of us have no choice but to follow the lead of those who have higher ranks.

そこで秋野さんが提案したんです
That's why Akino-san came up with a proposal...

クラスメイトに対してギフトを使うのは禁止にしてはどうかと
...recommending that we prohibit the usage of gifts against other classmates.


==p17==


ただ禁止と決めただけではこっそり使う者も出るかもしれない
However, some people might still try to do so secretly regardless of it being prohibited.

そこで
Therefore...

秋野さんの「偶像」のスキル『誓願』そ使って
Using Akino-san's skill "Oath" from her "Idol" class...

誓いを立ててそれを守らせるの
She would request them take an oath and keep it.

これが誓いを守ることで願いを叶えることができるっていうとんでもないスキルだったのよね
It's quite a ridiculous skill that can fulfill wishes as long as you don't break the oath.

誓いを破ると願いの規模に応じて代償そ払うことになる
If you break the oath, then you have to pay a price according to the scale of the wish.

「クラスメイトに力そ使わない」誓いで「所持スキルのランクアップ」をきせたの
With an oath that "I would not use my powers against my classmates", people were able to "rank up their skills".


==p18==


なるほど...?
戦力の底上げとクラスメイト間の安心材料にはなるのかな?
I think I get it...? So it was a good way to boost the overall ability of the group while also providing a sense of security among classmates?

でも それだと結局みんな秋野さんの言いなりになるってことじゃ?
But, doesn't that mean that everyone is at the mercy of Akino-san in the end?

そうなんだけど...
結局女子の大多数が秋野さん案に賛成して
Yeah, that's true but... The majority of the girls agreed with Akino-san's proposal anyways.

なし崩し的に秋野さんがリーダーになっちゃったの
And so Akino-san became the leader of the group without question.

うーん．．．
女子としてはエロゲ三貴族なんて能力そ見ちゃうとしかたないかなって思うけど
Hmmm... as a girl, I think it's kind of unavoidable considering the abilities of the three eroge aristocrats.

てことは俺たちもその能力で誓いを立てることになったら
However, if we also have to make that vow...

実はギフトを持ってないことがばれるかも...
it might be revealed that we don't actually have gifts...

で...でしたら私が秋野蒼空を始末してまいりますので！
I-if that's the case, then I will get rid of Akino Sora!!

物騒だな!
Why are you so hasty!

もうちょっと穏便にいこうよ！
Please calm down a bit!

「誓願」も無制限に使えるわけじゃないらしいの
Well, it seems there are limits to the number of "Oath" usages.

特に危険な能力そ持つ人に限って誓わせてるのが現状よ
The current situation is that only those who have particularly dangerous abilities are under oath.


==p19==


じゃそれはばれた時に考えるか
Well, can't we just think about it when we get exposed?

...そういえば高遠くんたちはなんで合流したの?
...Come to think of it, why did you guys decide to link back up with us?

ギフトもなくてここまで二人で来れるぐらいならつるまなくても余裕で生きていけるでしょ?
If you two could get this far without any gifts, you could probably live here comfortably without getting bored, right?

賢者のシオンって人と話をしたいんだよ
We wanted to talk with a certain person, the sage Sion.

この世界に喚んだ張本人なんだから
Since they are the one who summoned us to this world...

帰る方法を何か知ってないかと思って
We wondered if they might know anything about returning home.

帰る...?!
Returning home...?!

え．．．ああそうだょね？！
普通は帰ろうと思うょね...
ah... yeah, that's right! It would be normal to want to go home...

え？
eh?

．．．私も
Me too...

もう帰れないという前提で考えていました．．．
だから賢者にならねばと...
I was thinking on the premise that I wouldn't be able to return home... That I would have to work towards becoming a sage...


==p20==


ふむ...
hmm...

システムのインストール後は思考誘導が行われておるのかもしれぬな
The system installation might have added some sort of thought guidance or filtering.

高遠くんみんなにこのことそ教えて協力したら...?
Takatou-kun, why don't we tell everyone this and work together...?

うーん．．．
hmm...

いや...
やめとこう
Nah, let's not.

シオンの提示した試練の期間は一か月だしそのためのグループ分けもきっちり済んでる
The length of the trial presented by Sion was one month, and the group is focused on getting that done.

今さら「元の世界に帰る」って別の目的を追加したって混乱するだけだろ
It might just confuse things if we add another goal of "returning to our original world".

たしかに...
合格者が出なければ最悪二度と賢者と話す機会すらないかもしれません
Definitely... And if there are no successful candidates, the worst case is just that we never get a chance to talk with the sages.

てことは試練は試練でみんなに合格してもらわないとね
In the end, the trials are trials, and we need to get everyone to pass them.


==p21==


一応聞くけど
I'll ask you now, but for the time being...

俺たちは協力関係ってことでいいんだよね?
Is it fine for us to be in a cooperative alliance?

そうだよ?
私はそのっもり
Sure? That's what I planned to do.

も...もちろんです！！
O-of course!!

なんなりとお申し付けください！！
Order me to do anything as you please!!

とりあえず割り当ての部屋に戻ろうか
For now, let's head back to our assigned rooms.

はい！
Okay!

...あ　でも男女別々だし壇ノ浦さんとは別階になっちゃうのか
...Ah, but men and women are separated, so I guess I will be on a different floor from Dannoura-san.

お? 残念そうね 高遠くん
Oh? You look disappointed, Takatou-kun.

まあね
Well, that's true.

コラー！！
Hey!!


==p22==


じゃ　また
Well, cya.

私たちも戻ろっか! 諒子
Let's head back too, Ryouko!

はい．．．
yeah...

にしても．．．
Even still...

高遠くん
そこまで無敵の存在って感じもしないよね
It doesn't feel as though Takatou-kun is an invincible existence.

．．．は？！
...Ha?!

何を言ってるんですキャロル!!
What are you saying, Carol-san!!

だってそうでしよ?
異世界転移に巻き込まれちゃってるしさ
Well, it's true isn't it? After all, he got forcibly transferred to another world like the rest of us.

それに過去には研究所の地下でずっと暮らしてたんでしょ?
And didn't he use to live in the basement of the laboratory all the time?

そ...それはそうですが...!
T-that's right, but...!

つまり殺意がなけれぱ
In other words, if there's no killing intent...

高遠くんの意図しない形で移動させたり隔離は可能ってことだよね
It's possible to forcibly move Takatou-kun without his permission and isolate him, right?

...何が言いたいんですか?
What are you trying to say...?


==p23==


知千佳にご執心なようだし?
Isn't he obsessed with Tomochika?

無力化するには人質作戦なんて有効...
A hostage situation seems like it would be an effective method for...

黙れよ!
Shut the fuck up!!

それをやった奴らがどうなったと思っている！!
Guess what happened to the guys who did that last time!!

人質だ? 馬鹿かお前は！ 逆なんだよ！
A hostage? Are you stupid!! It's the other way around!!

私たちは今後！
It's up to us from now on!!

命に代えても壇ノ浦知千佳を守らはくちゃならなくなったんだよ！
Even if it costs us our lives, we must protect Dannoura Tomochika!!


==p24==


ふざけんな! お前も「機関」も！
Stop fucking around! You and your "Agency"!

私を! 他の人間を! 世界を巻去込むな!
Don't go involving me, other people, and the rest of the world!!

死にたいなら一人で死ね!
介錯してやるからよ！！
If you want to die, then go die by yourself!! I'll even kill you right now if you want*!!

ご．．．ごめん．．．
S-sorry...

高遠夜霧に対しては...
When it comes to Takatou Yogiri...

何人も一切何もしてはならない
No one should try anything.

どれほど無害に見えようと一瞬たりとも油断などしてはならないのだ
No matter how harmless he looks, you can't let your guard down for a moment.

「研究所」は彼を禍神の類と捉えている
The "laboratory" sees him as some kind of evil god.


==p25==


それは人の手にあまるものであり
As an existence that can't be handled by humans.

その災いはただ受け入れるしかなく
You just have to accept the impending calamity.

鎮まるのをただ伏して願うしかない存在なのだと一
In which there's no choice but to lie down and pray it passes...


==p26==


よう高遠!
同じグループだな
Yo Takatou-kun! We're in the same group.

落ちこぼれ同士よろしくな!
Welcome to the leftovers group!

悠吾くん
Yuugo-kun

高遠くんは未評価だからとりあえずここヘ入れられただけでまだわからないよ?
Takatou-kun hasn't been evaluated yet, so he was only put with us for the time being. He's not yet considered useless like us...

あれっ
そうなの?
Huh, is that so?

でも虫を殺せるだけの能力って聞いたけど
But I heard that your ability is just able to kill insects.

うん
Yeah

えっと．．．
君たち誰だっけ?
Uhm... who are you guys, by the way?

おいおい
マジかょ!
Oi oi, you're kidding right?!

俺は泉田悠吾!
峙々話しかけてただろーが!
I'm Izumida Yuugo! I've talked with you a bunch of times!


==p27==


ははっ
高遠くんいっも眠そうだったからね
Haha, Takatou-kun was asleep quite often after all.

僕は愛原幸正
クラスは読害家だょ
My name is Aihara Yukimasa and my class is Reader.

どんな言語で害かれた本でも読めるだけの能力だけどね
My ability lets me read books that are written in any language.

俺は料理人
Mine is Cook.

適当に作っても飯が美味いってぐらいのもんで戦闘の役には立たないけどな!
Even if I don't try that hard, the food end's up delicious, but it's not useful at all in combat.

ん？
hm?

だれだろ？ はーい！
Who's that? Coming!

げ!!
深井かょなんの用だょ...
Geh!! What are you here for, Fukai...

た．．．高遠くん．．．
T-takatou-kun...

ちょ　ちょっと...
言...いいかな．．．？
C-can I talk to you f-for a second...?


==p28==


え？　俺？
eh? me?

いいけど．．．えっとだれだっけ？
That's fine but... uhm, who are you?

深井... 聖一...
Fukai... Seiichi...

もっともこれまでは...
Up until now...

話しかけることも...
直接見ることも...
許されてなかったんだ...
To talk to you...
Or see you directly...
I wasn't allowed to...

おいおい 高遠...
部屋に入れちまって大丈夫か?
Hey, Takatou...
Are you sure it's fine to let him in?

こいっもともとよくわかんねー奴だったけどさ異世界来てから完全に何言ってるかわかんねーんだよな
I didn't really know this guy beforehand, but ever since we came to another world, I haven't been able to understand anything he talks about.

そうなの？
Really?

言って俺に？
What'd you want to talk about?


==p29==


話...　そう...
Talk... Yeah...

僕は... 高遠くんと．．．　いや
I... Takatou-kun and... No

もう... 隠す必要もないのかな...
Well... you don't need to keep hiding it...

おかくし様
Okakushi-sama

こいつが「教団」からの監視者か...
Is this guy the observer from the "Cult"...

死神... そう...
Shinigami... yeah...

死を司る．．．
全ての生殺与奪を握る．．．
To govern death... To control the death of all living creatures...

絶対無比の力．．．
An absolutely unrivaled power...


==p30==


ひっ．．．？！
ehh...?!

「おかくし様を直接見てはいけない」
"Do not look directly at Okakushi-sama."

そんな掟のために僕の眼はえぐり取られた...
Because of that rule, my eye was extracted...

なのにお側で見守り続けろと．．．
But I was supposed to stay by your side, and watch over you...

超常なるものを見通す「聖眼」を与えられた...
And so, I was given the "Saint Eye", which can see paranormal things...


==p31==


理不尽だと思わないかい...?
it's unreasonable, don't you agree...?

俺のせいだとでも言いたいの?
Are you trying to say that it's my fault?

眼を外すとか何がしたいんだよ
And what are you trying to do, removing the eye and all?

この眼は...
異世界に来てから力を失ってしまった
This eye... since coming to this world, has lost its power...

教母様の力が届かなくなってしまったから...
Because, godmother's power doesn't reach here...

その代わり...
僕には新しくギフトの力が
Instead, through the gift, I was given new power...

深井のギフトって?
What is Fukai's gift?

あ．．．
確か即死魔法だったよな?
Ah, I'm pretty sure it was instant death magic, right?

「死神」のクラスだっけか
And his class was "Shinigami" I think.

ランク4だったょね
It was Rank 4.

あなたが...
you...

まるで力を解放していないことがわかった
You're not releasing your power, I understand.

後は僕がこの力で引き継ぐ...
Later I will, with this power, take over...

あなたは好きにしていればいい
You, as you wish, do whatever.


==p32==


僕の力...
My power...

おかくし様に全てを任せる必要なんてない
No longer do we need to leave everything to Okakushi-sama.

教母様も...
コントロールしょうのない
あなたなんかょり
Godmother-sama too, instead of you, who can't be controlled...

僕の方を重用してくださるに決まってる...
Will favor using me more...

あいつやっぱりなんかおかしいだろ
There's definitely something wrong with him.

高遠も気にしなくていいと思うぞ
It's probably best if you don't worry about him, Takatou-kun.

...こんなの置いていかれてもなあ...
...He really left this behind...

いる？
You want it?

いらねえよ！！
Why would I want something like that?!

お前もなんかどっかおかしいな？！
Is there something wrong with you too?!

ch37 = 5/26

on page 24, Ryouko tells Carol she'll kill her right there if she wants. She really says something like "I will perform the beheading as the ending to a seppuku" but I don't know how common knowledge of that is or how to write that in a way that fit the context so I wrote something similar.

on page 29, Seiichi calls Yogiri "Okakushi-sama". The same word used in chapter 14 in which i wrote the notes that it means something like: hidden/secret lord or a more honorable way of saying Lord-sama.

in the webnovel, it explains that there were more girls traveling with the class since quite a few guys had gone off to do their own thing, including the original three that challenged yogiri.

Seiichi speaks in a disjointed/hard-to-follow/out-of-order way, so I tried to model that in my translation.
